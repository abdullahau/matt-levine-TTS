                "In 2018, Tesla Inc. gave Elon Musk, its chief executive officer and Technoking, a big package of stock options to motivate him to transform Tesla from about a $59 billion company into a trillion-dollar company. This worked. Tesla’s equity market capitalization peaked at about $1.5 trillion last year; it’s hovering around $1 trillion today. Musk’s “moonshot” package of stock options is worth, at today’s prices, about $87 billion. [Footnote 1: That is, 303,960,630 shares in the options grant, times (about $308.16 as of noon today, minus the $23.34 strike price).] That is both a lot of money and kind of a bargain; it does seem unlikely that a different CEO would have added a trillion dollars of value to Tesla. [Footnote 2: Or, also, subtracted half a trillion dollars of value; Musk’s absolute performance is maybe more impressive than his Sharpe ratio, but never mind.]",
                "And then last year a Delaware judge ruled that this options package was invalid, for conflict-of-interest and disclosure reasons. (She found that Tesla’s board, which approved the options, was in Musk’s pocket, and that the outside shareholders who also approved it were not fully informed about the deal.) Tesla responded by:",
                "1. Asking shareholders to approve the package again, and",
                "2. Moving its state of incorporation to Texas, so that Delaware judges couldn’t meddle in Musk’s pay anymore.",
                "Shareholders approved both measures, and the second one worked (Tesla is in Texas now), but the first one didn’t, or at least, it didn’t yet: The Delaware judge found that reapproving the options doesn’t bring them back to life, so they are still invalid. That decision is being appealed. But, for now, Musk’s $87 billion of options are gone.",
                "This situation strikes Musk, and Tesla’s board, and many of its shareholders, and also frankly me, as pretty unfair. Tesla did make a deal with Musk, that it would make him rich(er) if he made Tesla shareholders rich; he held up his end of the deal, but he has not gotten the options he was promised.",
                "We are also, in 2025, in a pretty interesting market for a man of Elon Musk’s talents. Right now, if you are a talented artificial intelligence researcher, your market value is on the order of hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of dollars. If you are a talented AI executive — if your skill set is not building generative AI models, but attracting and motivating people who build generative AI models — your market value is even higher. Sam Altman’s value to OpenAI is plausibly 100% of its valuation, which is $300 billion.",
                "I am not saying that, if Elon Musk polished up his LinkedIn and started sending around a resume, Mark Zuckerberg would pay him $90 billion to lead AI efforts at Meta. (Though I am writing a pilot for that sitcom.) I am saying, though, that if Musk were to go and start a new AI startup, he could easily raise billions of dollars at a 12-digit valuation. Also he has already done that. The startup is xAI, it raised a $10 billion round last month and it’s in talks to do more at a $200 billion valuation. I don’t know a lot about xAI’s cap table, but Musk might own one third of it, meaning that his stake is worth something like of $70 billion. The outside bid for Musk’s services — what he could get for building AI stuff away from Tesla — is on the order of $70 billion. And meanwhile Tesla paid him, like, negative $87 billion last year? I would quit!",
                "That’s oversimplified. Tesla is a very important part of Musk’s empire. He owns about $127 billion worth of Tesla stock even without the 2018 options, and because Tesla is his only public company, that stock is easier to turn into cash (by selling or pledging) than his private shares are. Musk’s projects require a lot of money, and Tesla is often the most straightforward source of that money. But he does have a lot of projects, and it would be understandable if he devoted his incremental efforts to projects that would pay him a lot of upside rather than to an already-large slow-growing public company where he arguably worked for free for the last seven years. [Footnote 3: I would not argue that very hard: Again, he’s a big shareholder of Tesla, so his own wealth increased by tens of billions of dollars due to his efforts, even without the options. Plenty of tech founder-CEO-shareholders *don’t* get huge options packages, and are motivated by their own shareholdings. (Presumably Musk isn’t getting random new options grants at xAI.) Still, a deal is a deal, etc.]",
                "It’s possible that the optimal outcome here is for (1) Musk to quit Tesla to go build AI stuff at xAI and (2) Tesla to hire a normal car executive to run a normal car company, but I doubt that many Tesla shareholders or directors think that. (That trillion-dollar valuation is not a normal-car-company valuation.) So Tesla’s board would like to throw giant gobs of stock back at Musk to keep him aligned and motivated.",
                "Presumably it can do that, because now Tesla is incorporated in Texas and the whole point of doing that was that everyone assumes ( though nobody knows ) that Texas courts will let it pay Musk whatever it wants. But there are tax and accounting issues. When Musk got those options in 2018, they weren’t worth very much, as an accounting matter: They were at the money (the strike price he would pay to exercise the options was equal to the market price) and highly contingent (he’d only get the options if he hit a series of aggressive operational and financial targets, including getting Tesla’s market cap to $650 billion), and they might well turn out to be worthless. If Tesla gave Musk the same options again, now, they’d be worth a ton of money: They’re very in-the-money (the stock has gone up more than 1,000%) and not contingent at all (he’s already hit all the targets). That means that (1) he would pay very high taxes on them and (2) Tesla would take a big charge to earnings. Giving him different options — at-the-money options contingent on hitting new targets — might be better (to motivate him to hit the new targets!), but would effectively leave him unpaid for his last seven years of work.",

                "<start quote>\nTesla Inc. approved an interim stock award worth about $30 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a massive payout meant to keep the billionaire’s attention on the automaker as a legal fight over a 2018 pay package drags on. The new agreement includes 96 million shares of the automaker that will vest if Musk continues to serve in the top post for another two years, the company said Monday in a regulatory filing. The restricted stock [Footnote 4: For reasons that elude me, the new award is documented as “restricted stock” that Musk has to pay $23.34 for, rather than “options” with a $23.34 strike price. (“Participant shall pay the Company $23.34 per Share of Restricted Stock that vests in accordance with this Award Agreement.”) Ordinarily restricted stock doesn't have a strike price, but I guess this is the most efficient way to recreate the 2018 options.] has an exercise price of $23.34, equal to the price in the prior compensation plan. … The board emphasized the importance of retaining Musk, saying in a shareholder letter released Monday that the award was a first step “good faith” payment. “After all, a ‘deal is a deal.’” It said it’s working on a longer-term CEO compensation strategy, which will be put to a vote at the EV maker’s Nov. 6 annual meeting.\n<end quote>",
                "Here are the filing, the terms of the new options, and the shareholder letter, which makes it clear that this is meant to (1) compensate Musk for his past work:",
                "<start quote>\nTo recognize what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value he delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honor the bargain that was struck in 2018. After all, “a deal is a deal.” Thus, as evidence that Tesla is committed to honoring its promises in the 2018 CEO Performance Award and intends to compensate its CEO for his future services commensurate with his contributions to our company and shareholders, we have recommended this award as a first step, “good faith” payment to Elon.\n<end quote>",
                "And (2) keep him from running off with an AI startup:",
                "<start quote>\nIt is imperative to retain and motivate our extraordinary talent, beginning with Elon. The war for AI talent is intensifying, with recent months including multi-billion-dollar acquisitions of companies and nine-figure cash compensation packages for non-founder, individual AI engineers. Even among this group of highly talented individuals, no one matches Elon’s remarkable combination of leadership experience, technical expertise, and, arguably most importantly, decades-long proven track record of building the most revolutionary and profitable businesses across different industries. While we recognize that Elon’s business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging, including his leadership roles at xAI, SpaceX, Neuralink, X Corp., and The Boring Company as well as his other interests, we are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla and focus his unmatched leadership abilities on further creating shareholder value for Tesla shareholders and attracting and retaining talent at Tesla. To be clear, losing Elon would not only mean the loss of his talents but also the loss of a leader who is a magnet for hiring and retaining talent at Tesla.\n<end quote>",
                "Fine. But the funniest part of the filing is the section on “accounting consequences.” [Footnote 5: In what percentage of corporate filings is the “accounting consequences” the funniest part? Like, 10%, right?] The accounting consequences are: none. Tesla argues that this $30 billion award is worth nothing, because Musk is unlikely ever to get the shares;",
                "<start quote>\nThe Company expects to account for the 2025 CEO Interim Award as a grant of restricted stock with a performance condition in accordance with ASC Topic 718, which for purposes of the 2025 CEO Interim Award is based upon the probability of certain conditions being met.

As of the date of this report, the Company expects that the performance condition of the 2025 CEO Interim Award will not be deemed to be probable of being met. As a result, the Company currently expects that it will not recognize a compensation expense upon the issuance of the award.\n<end quote>",
                "That is, the performance conditions in the new award are so onerous that they are unlikely to be satisfied, so Musk is unlikely to get these shares, so Tesla doesn’t have to expense them.",
                "Which is weird: These new options are meant to replace the 2018 options; they are meant to reward them for his prior performance. Putting in onerous new performance conditions seems rough on him. What are these onerous new conditions? Well, there are no operational or financial targets. Tesla doesn’t have to hit a $2 trillion market cap, or sell more cars or develop autonomous robots. The only thing that Musk actually has to do to get the award is:",
                "<start quote>\nA requirement that Elon serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla during the two-year vesting term.\n<end quote>",
                "Huh. Tesla is saying it’s so unlikely that Musk will stay for two years, that the options are worth zero?",

                "That is, if the Delaware decision gets overturned on appeal and Musk gets his 2018 options back, then these options go away. Perhaps Tesla’s accountants are confident that the decision will be overturned, so they think the probability of him actually getting these options is low.",

            "summary": "Matt Levine explains that Tesla's substantial 2018 stock option package for Elon Musk, intended to incentivize him to dramatically increase the company's value, was highly successful but later invalidated by a Delaware judge due to conflict-of-interest and disclosure issues. To address this, Tesla attempted to get shareholders to re-approve the package and moved its incorporation to Texas, but the Delaware court still found the compensation invalid, leaving Musk's promised eighty-seven billion dollars of options effectively gone for now. Levine emphasizes the perceived unfairness of this situation, especially considering Musk's immense value in the current \"war for AI talent,\" where executives and researchers command enormous sums, and he notes Musk's own successful AI venture, xAI, which could be seen as an alternative path for his efforts.\n\nThe main topics include executive compensation, corporate governance, the power of judicial oversight in corporate law, the strategic reincorporation of companies, and the competitive landscape for top-tier talent, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector. Levine maintains a tone of dry humor and mild skepticism, highlighting the absurdity of certain corporate actions, such as Tesla's reincorporation to avoid Delaware's scrutiny and the peculiar accounting treatment of a new interim stock award for Musk. He playfully questions the notion that Musk would work for free while acknowledging his substantial existing Tesla holdings.\n\nThe broader context revolves around a high-stakes legal and financial battle over a CEO's compensation at a major public company. The article delves into the background of the 2018 \"moonshot\" compensation package, which tied Musk's pay directly to massive growth targets, and how its invalidation by the Delaware Court of Chancery set off a chain of events including Tesla's highly publicized decision to reincorporate in Texas. This move signifies a broader trend among some companies to seek more lenient corporate legal environments. The core insight is that Tesla is now scrambling to retain and re-motivate its highly valuable, albeit controversial, chief executive, feeling compelled to uphold a \"deal is a deal\" principle amidst intense competition for top AI leadership. The article details Tesla's recent announcement of an interim thirty billion dollar stock award to Musk, which the company incredibly claims has no accounting consequences because its vesting is deemed \"improbable\" due to conditions that effectively link it to the ongoing appeal of the original options' invalidation and his continued service for two years.\n\nNotable financial terms and references include \"stock options,\" \"equity market capitalization,\" \"strike price,\" \"in-the-money options,\" \"restricted stock,\" and \"compensation expense,\" with a specific nod to ASC Topic 718 regarding accounting for stock-based compensation. The \"war for AI talent\" is also a significant market reference, contextualizing Musk's value outside of Tesla."

                "One of the more embarrassing facts in finance is that stuff — stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. — that went up last month will probably go up this month. [Footnote 6: This is extremely not investing advice, and don’t take that time scale too seriously. Antti Ilmanen: “The common empirical finding is a return continuation tendency (momentum bias) except for very short and very long windows (a week or shorter, two to five years) where reversal bias may dominate.” That’s mostly about commodities, though stocks are similar (“a strong multi-month momentum effect sandwiched between short-term and long-term reversal effects”), and “momentum strategies perform well in virtually all asset classes we study,” though not always at the same time scales.] This is embarrassing because it seems to undermine the idea of efficient markets: “Market prices incorporate all available information, except they always forget whether prices went up last month.” It seems hard to explain except with a story of investor irrationality. On the Money Stuff Podcast, Cliff Asness pointed out that the two main explanations are (1) “investors underreact to news” and (2) “investors overreact to news,” which is additionally embarrassing.",
                "There are people who make a nice living from this embarrassing fact: You buy stuff that went up last month, you short stuff that went down last month, and probably you make money. This is called “trend following.” [Footnote 7: More or less. As Asness also pointed out on that podcast episode, it’s “trend following” in macro and commodities markets, and “momentum” in individual stocks.] My impression is that most of the hedge funds who make a living from this have more sophisticated models than this but, you know. Something like this.",
                "But this doesn’t always work; it just mostly works. It works when markets are somewhat irrational. A medium amount of irrational, at a medium time horizon. I wrote a few months ago that “the current economic policy of the United States is apparently to cause maximum chaos by announcing drastic changes in the global economic order in the morning and then walking them back at lunchtime.” That is a change from the previous economic policy of the US, which was to try to be pretty stable to allow for rational economic planning. When the world is basically stable, the stuff that went up last month will probably go up this month. When the US imposes huge tariffs one month and walks them back the next month, the stuff that went up last month will probably go down this month. [Footnote 8: Also not investing advice.] The regime has changed; a new and stronger source of irrationality has been added to the market. It’s hard to make a living following trends when there are no trends. The Wall Street Journal reports:",

Meanwhile, hedge funds more broadly returned 4%, net of fees, while the S&P 500 delivered 6.2% to investors, including dividends.... At Man Group, seen as a trend-following pioneer, the flagship AHL Alpha fund is down 7.8% through June.... Because trend-following funds can take days or weeks to fully buy into a change in a market’s direction, they can be left playing catch-up if asset prices quickly reverse. The funds’ signals might instruct them to buy—just before an unexpected catalyst suddenly sends other investors rushing to sell. This year, Trump’s capricious tariff moves and sudden social-media announcements have stoked volatility across asset classes, including stocks, currencies and commodities. Last week, for instance, U.S. copper prices suddenly plunged after the president surprised traders by unveiling 50% tariffs on copper products, but not on the raw material itself.\n<end quote>",
                "In general I do not have a ton of sympathy for hedge fund managers who say things like “the market has become too irrational now, so it is hard for me to make money.” That’s not how it’s supposed to work! When the market is irrational, there are lots of opportunities for smart rational hedge fund managers; if it is hard for you to make money using your old tricks, that suggests that the market has become more rational. If I had told you in 2015 that trend following wouldn’t work in 2025, you might have said “ah, yes, as artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and hedge funds get more competitive, it should be harder to make money by just buying the stuff that went up last month.” But that is probably not quite what happened."

            "summary": "Matt Levine discusses an \"embarrassing fact\" in finance: that assets which performed well in the recent past often continue to perform well, a phenomenon known as momentum or trend following. He explains that this strategy, which profits from a moderate level of market irrationality, is currently failing because extreme and unpredictable policy changes, such as sudden tariff announcements by the US government, have created an environment of excessive chaos, making consistent trends impossible to discern.\n\nThe main topics include the concept of market momentum and trend following strategies, the implications for the efficient market hypothesis, and how political and policy instability can disrupt traditional investment approaches. Levine maintains his characteristic humorous and slightly cynical tone, pointing out the irony of financial experts explaining market behavior with contradictory theories like \"underreaction\" and \"overreaction,\" and the \"embarrassing\" nature of basic momentum working at all. He also highlights the apparent paradox of hedge funds complaining about market irrationality, suggesting that such an environment should theoretically present more opportunities for skilled managers, unless their own models are ill-suited to extreme volatility.\n\nThe broader context is an examination of why a historically effective quantitative trading strategy is currently struggling. Levine's core insight is that while trend following thrives on a certain degree of predictable market irrationality or stability, it breaks down when there is overwhelming, unpredictable chaos, particularly that stemming from sudden shifts in government economic policy. This shift from a relatively stable policy environment to one characterized by frequent, drastic changes makes it impossible for trend following models to identify consistent patterns.\n\nNotable financial terms and references include \"momentum bias\" or \"return continuation tendency,\" \"reversal bias,\" \"efficient markets,\" and \"trend following.\" He also references financial thought leaders like Antti Ilmanen and Cliff Asness, and specific entities like Man Group's AHL Alpha fund, as well as the S&P 500 benchmark.

Secondly, Levine points out that President Donald Trump is holding private meetings with prominent bank CEOs, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, to solicit pitches on how to monetize the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially through a major public stock offering.\n\nThe main topics revolve around Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, government financial incentives and procurement programs, the monetization of large government-sponsored entities, and the pervasive issue of potential conflicts of interest at the intersection of high-level politics and finance.\n\nLevine's tone is highly sarcastic and critical, using humor to underscore the apparent lack of concern for conflicts. He expresses mock surprise that no spokesperson bothered to issue a denial of conflict, implying the situation is so blatant it's almost expected. His humor peaks when he speculates on the \"shameless\" pitches banks might make, wondering satirically if merging Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with the Trump sons' SPAC would be considered the \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer for a truly audacious proposal.\n\nThe broader context of this passage is Levine's ongoing commentary on the ethical complexities and financial implications when political power and business interests are closely intertwined. His article-level insight suggests that these two separate news items, when viewed together, paint a picture where the Trump family's business ventures are positioned to directly benefit from government influence, and he subtly critiques a system where such potential conflicts are seemingly accepted without even a pro forma denial.\n\nNotable financial terms and references include \"blank cheque investment vehicle\" or \"Special Purpose Acquisition Company\" (SPAC), which is a shell company formed to raise capital to acquire an existing company; \"monetizing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\" referring to the process of potentially privatizing or raising capital from these government-sponsored enterprises; and \"public offering of stock,\" which is the sale of a company's shares to the public.
