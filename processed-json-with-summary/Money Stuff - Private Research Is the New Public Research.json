                "2. Anyone can buy shares in public companies on the stock exchange; private companies’ shares don’t generally trade.",
                "Those two things traditionally go together: Public companies can sell stock to anyone because they disclose information to everyone. But that is not an inevitable fact of nature; it is just a somewhat complicated consequence of US securities laws. And I get the sense that it is changing. Specifically, we seem to be getting closer to a world where anyone (or at least a lot of people) can buy shares in private companies (or at least some of the bigger ones), without those companies disclosing any financial information. We have talked about “tokenization,” which I interpret as a sort of Trojan horse for making private-company stocks freely tradable without disclosure. Or there are plans to allow private equity in 401(k) plans, and more generally to offer more private assets to regular investors.",
                "How will regular investors evaluate these investments, if their financials aren’t public? The actual answer is “they won’t, and that’s fine.” It’s not like most ordinary investors who buy shares of public companies are reading the financial statements and building valuation models. They buy a stock because they like the company and because they assume that the institutional investors whose trading sets the price know what they’re doing. The same thing probably more or less works with big well-known private companies. If you have the chance to invest in OpenAI or SpaceX at the price of its last funding round, I’m not saying you should — this is not investing advice — but I am saying that professionals with a lot of money on the line probably put some work into deciding that that price was fine, so that price is probably fine for you. There are many, many, many ways for this to go wrong (“Invest in OppenAI for just $75 per share, big venture capital firms like a15z and Kleinman Parker are scrambling to get in,” your spam folder probably says), but the basic idea — that market prices are usually efficient enough for amateur investors to rely on — is mostly fine, even if private companies do not always have “market prices” in the ordinary sense.",
                "Still it’s better if the regular investors can log into their broker’s website and read some research telling them what their private companies are worth.

Unlike traditional equity research on public firms, the new offering won’t include ratings, price targets or estimates on private companies, Hussein Malik, JPMorgan’s head of global research, said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. The goal is to provide investor clients with structured information and tracking, he said. “Private companies are increasingly pivotal in shaping the growth and outlook of industries,” Malik said in an external note to clients. “Understanding their impact is and will remain crucial for both public and private market investors to make informed investment decisions.”\n<end quote>",

It does feel a little bit like that’s where we are heading."

            "summary": "Matt Levine discusses the evolving landscape of corporate finance, specifically how the traditional distinctions between public and private companies are eroding. Historically, public companies provided regular financial disclosures and allowed anyone to buy their shares on an exchange, while private companies did not. Levine observes that this separation, rooted in US securities laws, is changing. He points to trends like \"tokenization\" and proposals to include private equity in 401(k) plans as ways for more people to invest in private companies, even without the companies disclosing detailed financial information.\n\nLevine acknowledges the potential concern about how regular investors would evaluate such investments without public financials. With his characteristic pragmatic and slightly humorous tone, he suggests that for many ordinary investors, this isn't a new problem. He explains that most retail investors buying public company stock don't meticulously read financial statements or build complex valuation models; instead, they often rely on the assumption that large institutional investors, whose trading sets the price, have done their due diligence. This \"market efficiency\" concept, Levine argues, could largely apply even to well-known private companies like OpenAI or SpaceX, where professional money managers have already vetted the pricing of funding rounds. He injects a bit of humor by imagining spam emails about \"OppenAI\" investments, illustrating the risks of scams, but maintains that the basic idea of relying on market prices is generally sound for amateur investors.\n\nThe broader context of Levine's discussion is the increasing importance and accessibility of private markets, which necessitates new ways for investors to gain insights. He then transitions to the emerging role of financial institutions in providing information. He notes that Wall Street \"sell-side research\" already helps ordinary investors understand public companies. As an example, he mentions Bloomberg's report on JPMorgan Chase and Company expanding its research coverage to private companies, starting with OpenAI. He explains that JPMorgan's head of global research indicated this new offering would provide structured information and tracking for private firms, differing from traditional equity research by not including ratings, price targets, or financial estimates. The bank's goal is to help investors understand the significant impact of private companies on industries. Levine speculates that while initial research might be broad, it could eventually lead to private company chief financial officers providing detailed financial information to analysts, allowing private wealth bankers to sell these shares to clients, further blurring the lines between public and private investment opportunities. The notable financial terms and references include tokenization, 401(k) plans, private equity, market efficiency, valuation models, sell-side research, and references to companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, Nvidia, and JPMorgan."

                "Typically this problem comes up with regard to very junior investment bankers. The classic career path is that you graduate from college, spend two years as an investment banking analyst, and then leave for private equity. In recent years private equity recruiting has started earlier and earlier, so that by last year bankers interviewed for private equity jobs before even starting their banking jobs. This year banks, led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., have pushed back, and the big private equity firms have held off, for now, from starting “on-cycle recruiting” for their 2027 associate class.",
                "But the problem is, if anything, more acute for very senior investment bankers: If you are a top executive at a big investment bank, you make tens of millions of dollars managing a large and complex financial institution, but if you were a top executive at a big alternative asset manager (as the big private equity firms are now called), you could make hundreds of millions of dollars doing that. That’s more!",

The main things that investment bankers do are (1) advise companies on mergers and (2) arrange loans for leveraged buyouts; the main things that alternative asset managers do are (1) acquire companies in mergers (private equity) and (2) make loans for leveraged buyouts (private credit); each side intrudes a bit into the other’s turf. Banks have big asset management businesses, including alternative assets like private equity and credit. Just talk more about that and less about the investment banking.",

Selected applicants will get a full-time offer to join investment banking, followed by a shift to its asset-management unit — which has a private-markets arm — after two years. “Our goal with such a talented cohort is to offer the options to you,” Dan Dees, co-head of global banking and markets, wrote in the memo. “I might be a little biased, but the path you find yourself on at Goldman Sachs might just be the one that keeps you here many, many years later.”\n<end quote>",

Goldman in fact did have a big private equity business, and did a lot of investing with its own balance sheet and with customer money, because that was a thing that investment banks did back then. Two legacies of the 2008 financial crisis were that (1) the big investment banks all either became or were acquired by regulated bank holding companies and (2) there were much stricter regulations about the businesses that those banks were allowed to do. And so I write all the time now about how non-banks (alts managers, hedge funds, etc.) are now doing businesses that used to be done by big investment banks, because the big investment banks have become more regulated and conservative.",

            "summary": "Investment banks are struggling to retain talent, from recent college graduates to top executives, because private equity firms and other alternative asset managers offer significantly higher compensation, not necessarily more interesting work. Junior bankers typically aim for private equity after two years in banking, and even senior bankers are drawn by the prospect of earning hundreds of millions compared to tens of millions. To combat this brain drain and align themselves with more lucrative business models, banks like Goldman Sachs are trying to reinvent themselves as alternative asset managers, a broader term for firms investing in assets like private equity and private credit rather than just traditional stocks and bonds.\n\nThe main themes discussed are the intense competition for talent in finance, the vast pay disparity driving this competition, and the evolving strategies of major financial institutions to adapt. Levine highlights the blurring lines between traditional investment banking—which involves advising companies on mergers and arranging loans for leveraged buyouts—and alternative asset management, which often involves acquiring companies directly (private equity) or making those leveraged buyout loans (private credit). He notes with a characteristic dry humor how Goldman Sachs's CEO wants to be paid like an alternative asset manager, and how the bank is telling shareholders it already is a top alternative asset manager. Goldman is even trying to keep its junior talent by offering an \"early entry point\" to its asset management unit, essentially providing an in-house path to buy-side careers that mimic private equity. The broader context for this shift is rooted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, which forced investment banks to become more regulated bank holding companies and scale back risky proprietary investing. Now, in a \"more permissive and deregulatory age,\" these banks, like Goldman, are seeking to reclaim activities that were previously part of their core business but were largely taken over by non-bank alternative asset managers. Notable financial terms include investment banking, private equity, alternative asset manager, leveraged buyout or LBO, private credit, on-cycle recruiting, and buy-side careers, all of which describe specific roles or types of financial entities and transactions aimed at acquiring or lending money to companies, often with the goal of significant profit."

This seems to me like a good plan for people who own a lot of crypto, and those people are constantly looking for small public companies to do this trade with.",

You might worry. “How long can this last,” you might wonder, and also “how can I turn this meme-y stock into actual money?” Just selling the stock won’t work: If you, the meme-linked controlling shareholder, start dumping your stock, the price will collapse. Non-recourse borrowing seems tough. (Who would lend you the money?) I once proposed donating the stock to get tax benefits, but that has problems too. [Footnote 1: The Internal Revenue Service essentially gives you 37% of the value of your stock (in a tax deduction), which might be better than you could get from a sale or non-recourse loan.

            "summary": "Matt Levine explores two ways companies leverage cryptocurrency. One common strategy involves a company holding a large amount of crypto to sell shares on the stock market for a premium, essentially getting the market to value their digital assets at double their worth. However, Levine focuses more on a reverse scenario: how a controlling owner of a \"meme stock\" company, whose shares are worth billions for no clear fundamental reason, can convert that unstable value into something tangible.\n\nThe central problem for these meme stock owners is how to monetize their shares without crashing the price, as direct sales or traditional loans are difficult. Levine suggests that the best solution is for the meme stock company to issue new shares at its inflated price and then use that capital to buy Bitcoin. He humorously points out that while building a real business is hard and new share issuance typically concerns investors, meme stock enthusiasts surprisingly embrace the creation of new shares when the proceeds are used for Bitcoin, seeing it as beneficial because it adds real, independent asset value to the company.\n\nThe main themes revolve around market irrationality, the unique dynamics of meme stocks, the perceived legitimacy and appeal of Bitcoin, and financial engineering to extract value from speculative bubbles. Levine's tone is wry and analytical, highlighting the absurd but often effective ways financial players navigate and exploit market enthusiasms. He describes this as a broader strategy of starting with speculative interest, moving to market acceptance, then diversification, and finally permanence, suggesting Bitcoin serves as a \"smooth exit\" for converting meme stock value into something more grounded. This strategy allows the controlling shareholder to eventually sell their own shares or borrow against them, as the company now possesses a floor of real asset value independent of its meme status. Notable financial terms include \"crypto treasury companies,\" which are firms holding significant cryptocurrency, \"meme stock,\" referring to shares driven by social media hype rather than fundamentals, \"dilution,\" which is the reduction in existing shareholders' ownership percentage from new share issuance, and the paradoxical \"accretive dilution,\" used by Levine to describe dilution that is seen as beneficial by shareholders due to the assets acquired. The passage concludes by pointing to a real-world example, Trump Media's reported Bitcoin acquisition, implying this theoretical strategy is now being applied."

                "It’s possible that my introduction to high finance was reviewing change-of-control clauses. It is a standard part of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions: One company wants to buy another, so the buyer will get a big stack of all the target’s contracts and read through them to see if the merger will cause any problems. Each contract will probably have a clause saying something like “the company may not transfer its rights and obligations under this contract to anyone else.” And then the question is: If the company is acquired in a merger, does that trigger that clause? Does being acquired count as a transfer of the contract? Or does nothing change?",
                "The normal answer is that nothing changes. (The normal form of merger, in the US, is the “reverse triangular merger,” in which a subsidiary of the acquirer merges into the target, leaving the target as the surviving company and wholly owned by the acquirer. Because the target is the surviving company, its contracts should continue uninterrupted: As far as its counterparties are concerned, nothing has happened to the company; it just has different owners.) But different contracts will say different words, and some of those words might sweep up mergers. Each contract will have its own long complicated definitions of terms like “transfer,” some of which might seem to include mergers.",
                "And so, back in my day, some junior M&A lawyer would have to review all the contracts and make a table of which ones might cause problems in a merger. Nowadays I assume it is done by AI. Back then, it struck me as a weird assignment to give to the junior lawyers: On the one hand, sure, it was incredibly tedious and no senior person would want to do it, but on the other hand, how were the junior lawyers supposed to know? You graduate from law school, you know nothing about mergers, you read some long dense paragraph defining the term “Prohibited Transfer,” and, what, you just take a wild guess about whether that includes reverse triangular mergers? How are you supposed to know the nuances of those terms, the things that courts have read into them, the accepted market standards for what they mean?",
                "As I got older, though, I realized that it’s fine because nobody knows. The dispute among Exxon Mobil Corp., Hess Corp. and Chevron Corp. is really incredibly embarrassing for lawyers everywhere. Exxon is the operating partner on a big lucrative oil joint venture in Guyana; Hess owns a non-operating stake, which makes up a big chunk of the total value of Hess. The joint venture agreement, which is not public, contains a right of first refusal: Exxon can buy back Hess’s stake if Hess tries to transfer it. Chevron agreed to buy Hess in a completely straightforward and garden-variety reverse triangular merger. Did that trigger the right of first refusal? Hess and Chevron said no. Exxon said yes, and last year it went to arbitration to try to enforce the right of first refusal.",

He explains that while the standard outcome for a reverse triangular merger is that a target company's contracts remain uninterrupted, the precise wording can lead to significant disputes. Levine highlights this through the two-year, multi-billion dollar arbitration between Exxon Mobil, Hess, and Chevron concerning a lucrative oil joint venture in Guyana, a situation he amusingly frames as incredibly embarrassing for lawyers everywhere given that the resolution hinged on interpreting seemingly straightforward contract language.\n\nThe main topics and themes discussed include the complexities of change-of-control clauses and rights of first refusal in mergers and acquisitions, particularly within the context of reverse triangular mergers. Levine touches on the critical role of due diligence and contract interpretation, the inherent ambiguity of legal language, and the surprising difficulty even seasoned professionals face in applying \"plain reading\" to contracts. There's a persistent thread of humor and mild cynicism about the legal profession, especially concerning the tedium assigned to junior lawyers and the protracted nature of disputes over what some describe as simple terms. The piece also underscores the vital importance of M&A for industries like oil and gas.\n\nThe broader context of this discussion is to illustrate how a fundamental aspect of corporate law – the transferability of contracts during an acquisition – can lead to massive, high-stakes disagreements, even when industry practice and common sense point to a clear outcome. Levine uses the high-profile Exxon-Hess-Chevron dispute over the Guyana oil field to exemplify the practical challenges of due diligence and the inherent uncertainties in legal interpretation, despite the crucial role mergers play in modern business. The article-level insight is that even standard legal clauses can create significant financial and strategic risks due to their potential for conflicting interpretations, affecting everything from company valuations to industry deal-making.\n\nNotable financial terms and references include change-of-control clauses, which are contract provisions triggered by a shift in company ownership; due diligence, the investigative process conducted by a buyer before an acquisition; mergers and acquisitions, the combining of companies; and the reverse triangular merger, a common structure where a subsidiary merges into the target to keep its contracts intact. Levine also discusses a right of first refusal, a contractual right to buy an asset before it's offered to others; joint ventures, business collaborations; arbitration, a private dispute resolution process; and merger arbitrageurs, investors who bet on acquisition outcomes. The Stabroek Block refers to the key oil discovery in Guyana, and the Association of International Energy Negotiators, or AIEN, provides template contracts for the energy industry, which were referenced in the dispute."

                "Obviously it makes sense for Polymarket to buy a little-known derivatives exchange, but the real move is for sports books to buy little-known derivatives exchanges. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em: If “regulated futures exchange” is the most efficient way to run a sports betting business, then the sports gambling sites really should get into the regulated futures exchange business."

            "summary": "Here is a summary and analysis of the provided text.\n\nPolymarket, a crypto betting platform that had been forced offshore by US regulators, is now returning to the American market. It is doing so by acquiring a smaller, already regulated derivatives exchange, allowing it to legally offer its prediction contracts, which Matt Levine notes are effectively operating as lightly regulated and tax advantaged sports betting.\n\nThe main topics discussed are regulatory maneuvering in the financial and crypto spaces, the unexpected convergence of prediction markets with sports gambling, and the substantial demand for legal betting services. Levine's tone is characteristic of his writing: it is dryly analytical, with a subtle, ironic humor about how regulations can create unintended pathways. He points out the ironic transformation of event contracts, originally classified as \"commodity futures,\" into a vehicle for what is essentially sports betting. His concluding thought, suggesting that traditional sportsbooks might also consider buying derivatives exchanges, is a witty, provocative observation typical of his insights into market dynamics.\n\nThe broader context of this piece is how companies strategically navigate complex financial regulations. Levine highlights how seemingly niche financial instruments or platforms, like prediction markets, can, by accident or design, gain access to much larger and more lucrative markets such as sports gambling, simply by fitting into existing regulatory frameworks. This reinforces his recurring theme that financial structures are increasingly permeating various aspects of commerce and entertainment.\n\nNotable financial terms mentioned include \"commodity futures,\" which are agreements to buy or sell a commodity at a future date for a predetermined price, and are here applied to event outcomes in an unusual way. Also mentioned are \"derivatives exchange,\" which is a marketplace for trading financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, and \"regulated futures exchange,\" which is a derivatives exchange that operates under specific government oversight, granting it legality for offering futures contracts. Finally, \"sports betting sites\" are platforms for wagering on athletic events, which Levine suggests Polymarket is effectively becoming under a different guise."

                "<start quote>\nI feel like I read a dozen articles a week about Jane Street Group, and they all mention how secretive and press-shy it is. … I used to work at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., back when people were writing stuff like that about Goldman. Goldman, people were saying in like 2010, used to be secretive and press-shy, but recently it had exploded into the public consciousness. But in a bad way! Goldman was “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,” people learned, when they first heard about it. There are a lot of financial firms that go from “relatively obscure” to “very well-known,” but usually for bad reasons. Jane Street, on the other hand, now gets constant press, but usually good press.\n<end quote>",
                "Ahahaha, well, yeah. Since then, Jane Street has become even more well-known, but for bad reasons. (India’s securities regulator accused it of doing massive market manipulation.) Last week Bloomberg’s Katherine Doherty and Bernard Goyder published a fun profile of the firm. (“Now the 25-year-old trading powerhouse is in the glare of a global spotlight,” etc.) I used to say that investment banks are socialist collectives run for the benefit of their employees, but that has gotten less true over time as they have become more institutionalized and more beholden to shareholders. But Jane Street remains a private partnership, and it really does sound like a socialist paradise (but with tons of money):",
                "<start quote>\nIt’s a privately controlled company so clandestine that it doesn’t publicly identify a leader at the top. A staffer who once tried to track down an email list of governing partners recalled giving up, learning that Jane Street doesn’t want something like that circulating, not even to people working there. … The firm spent a total of $4.1 billion on compensation and benefits last year, according to a bond prospectus, equating to an average of roughly $1.4 million per employee. … On top of that, Jane Street paid out $4.2 billion in capital to equity holders last year, the prospectus shows. The firm said that it had 38 equity unit holders as of March 31.... Rather than the usual hierarchy topped by a CEO, Jane Street is run collectively by a few dozen executives who generally eschew interviews and speaking engagements, lest it create the appearance that one has more clout than others.\n<end quote>",
                "That’s sweet. Also:",
                "<start quote>\nPeople close to the company say it stands out from other high-frequency firms that have grown into major players, as well as investment banks that once dominated the business. … Jane Street’s risk appetite is often greater, according to former employees and others close to the company. It’s willing to work out positions, including big blocks of stock, over time — even in niche areas, such as emerging-market ETFs.\n<end quote>",
                "Plausibly those things are related. The traditional justification for the old investment banking partnership culture was not just that it makes the partners feel important, it’s that if all of the senior risk-takers feel like they are part of a partnership, they can trust one another to take good risks with their collective capital. If you work for a powerful CEO and invest shareholder money, the CEO has to spend a lot of time thinking about managing your risks; if you and your 37 best friends share responsibility for investing your own collective billions, maybe you can trust each other more."
            ],
            "summary": "Matt Levine humorously observes that while he previously noted Jane Street Group was an unusual financial firm receiving mostly good press despite its secrecy, it has since, like many others including Goldman Sachs in its \"vampire squid\" era, gained public notoriety for negative reasons, specifically accusations of market manipulation by India's securities regulator. This sets the stage for a discussion of Jane Street's unique and highly secretive private partnership culture. Levine describes it as a \"socialist paradise\" due to its egalitarian, collective leadership structure—where no single CEO is identified and executives avoid public appearances to prevent perceived hierarchy—but one that offers immense wealth, with average employee compensation around $1.4 million annually and billions distributed among its few dozen equity holders. The passage also highlights Jane Street's distinct approach to risk, noting its greater appetite compared to other high-frequency firms and traditional investment banks, as it is willing to hold large, long-term positions even in niche areas like emerging-market ETFs. Levine suggests this higher risk tolerance is plausibly linked to its partnership model, where senior risk-takers, trusting one another as co-owners of collective capital, can make different kinds of decisions than employees managing shareholder money in a more institutionalized firm.\n\nThe main topics include the evolution of a financial firm's public reputation, the irony of Jane Street's shift from positive to negative notoriety, its extreme secrecy, its unique private partnership structure, and its exceptionally high employee compensation and collective leadership, which create an egalitarian yet immensely wealthy environment. Levine's characteristic dry wit and self-aware humor are preserved, especially in his playful description of Jane Street as a \"socialist paradise (but with tons of money)\" and his reference to Goldman Sachs as a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.\" The broader context is Levine's ongoing commentary on how financial firms, particularly major investment banks and trading houses, operate internally and are perceived publicly, often exploring the tension between old partnership cultures and modern shareholder-driven institutions. Notable financial terms and references include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., \"market manipulation,\" \"investment banks,\" \"private partnership,\" \"bond prospectus,\" \"equity holders,\" \"high-frequency firms,\" and \"emerging-market ETFs.\""
