                "A fixed-rate bond has interest-rate risk. If you buy a five-year $100 bond that pays interest of 8%, and then interest rates go up by one percentage point, your bond is only worth $96. As rates go up, the yield of your bond has to go up, and to make the yield go up the price has to drop.",
                "A floating-rate bond has, to a first approximation, no interest-rate risk. If you buy a five-year $100 bond that pays interest of SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a standard interest benchmark) plus 4%, then today it pays 8.28% interest ( SOFR is 4.28% ); if SOFR goes up by one percentage point, then the bond pays 9.28% and it\u2019s probably still worth about $100. As rates go up, the yield of your bond goes up (it pays more interest), so the price doesn\u2019t have to drop.",
                "But that\u2019s not entirely right: A floating-rate bond normally floats with some index of prevailing risk-free-ish interest rates, like SOFR. But most companies that issue floating-rate bonds are not themselves risk-free. If a company issues a bond with a rate of SOFR plus 4% \u2014 if it issues at a credit spread of 400 basis points over the risk-free rate \u2014 then that means that the market thinks it is 400 basis points riskier than risk-free. If circumstances change \u2014 if the company gets riskier \u2014 then the right interest rate for that company will go up, even if prevailing risk-free rates don\u2019t. If SOFR stays the same, but the company\u2019s credit risk increases, then the yield of the bond will have to go up, and to make the yield go up the price has to drop. That is, floating-rate bonds don\u2019t have much interest-rate risk, but they do have credit risk.",
                "You might find this a bit untidy. You might want a bond that pays a floating rate that is not tied to prevailing interest rates, not \u201cSOFR plus 4%\u201d or whatever, but rather one that pays a floating rate that is like \u201cwhatever the right rate is each quarter to make the bond worth $100.\u201d That is, you want the bond\u2019s interest rate to float with both prevailing interest rates and the issuer\u2019s credit spread, or rather to float with the combination of them.",
                "I\u2019m not exactly sure why you would want this. There\u2019s a fairly straightforward substitute, which is short-term debt: If a company borrows money for a month, and then next month it pays back the debt by borrowing new money for another month, then its borrowing costs will float with the market rate (each month it has to borrow at whatever rate the market demands). But I suppose that\u2019s kind of a pain \u2014 you have to do a whole new deal every month \u2014 and it might be tidier to have long-term debt with an interest rate that moves like short-term debt. There are not a lot of bonds like that, though, [Footnote 1: In theory investors can sort of roll their own version of this by buying (1) a floating-rate corporate bond plus (2) a credit default swap on the company.] for two reasons:",
                "1. It is mechanically complicated: How do you set, each month, a rate that will make the bond trade at $100?",
                "2. It is quite wrong-way, for the issuer. If a company sells a bond whose rate floats with its own credit, then as its credit gets worse, it has to pay more interest. Why would it want that? For the issuer, that bond is essentially very-short term financing; it needs to be repriced every month. If the company\u2019s credit gets really bad, it might have to pay 30% or 40% interest on that bond. If it gets even worse, there might be no rate it can pay to keep the bond priced at $100.",
                "The first problem is more or less solvable. One very partial solution, found in many syndicated loans, is to have some matrix of spreads based on financial metrics and/or credit ratings: \u201cThis loan pays interest of SOFR + 200, if the company is rated BBB- or better, or SOFR + 225, if it\u2019s rated BB+,\u201d etc.",
                "A more rigorous solution used to exist in the form of auction-rate securities (ARS), long-term bonds whose rates floated based on periodic auctions. (Brokers would put in bids saying \u201cwe will buy this bond at $100 with a rate of ____%,\u201d and whatever rate cleared the auction would be the new rate on the security.) This extremely did not solve the second problem, though: In 2008, as the market became very risk-averse, these auctions failed to find clearing prices, and the ARS market more or less died.",
                "MicroStrategy Inc. (now doing business as Strategy), the great financial innovator of our age, has delightfully solved both problems in the simplest possible way. This week it announced an offering of \u201cStretch\u201d preferred stock (\u201cVariable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock,\u201d ticker STRC) whose floating rate is designed to keep it priced at $100. The way it will do this is:",
                "1. MicroStrategy will just set the rate each month to whatever it thinks will get it to $100, but if it\u2019s wrong no biggie. This solves the first problem: There is no complex and gameable mechanism to set the interest rate; MicroStrategy just picks the rate that it thinks is best.",
                "2. If that process produces a rate that would be unpleasantly high for MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy will just pick a lower rate. If the rate required to make the thing trade at $100 would be, like, 20%, MicroStrategy has the flexibility to say \u201cno thank you we\u2019ll stick to 9%.\u201d",
                "That is oversimplified but not by much. [Footnote 2: In particular there are some limits on how quickly Strategy can *lower* the rate (no more than 25 basis points per month, plus any decline in SOFR for that month). So if this thing quickly traded to a 4% yield, it would trade above par, as Strategy couldn\u2019t lower the rate (from 9%) fast enough to bring it down. But it can\u2019t trade too far above par, since Strategy has a call right at 101. Strategy also points out that it can use *issuance* to manage the price: It has an at-the-market offering program for the Stretches, so if it trades up too much Strategy can sell more to bring the price down.] From the prospectus:",
                "<start quote>\nThe initial regular dividend rate will be 9.00% per annum. However, we will have the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to adjust the regular dividend rate applicable to subsequent regular dividend periods in the manner described in this prospectus supplement.... Our current intention, which is subject to change in our sole and absolute discretion, is to adjust the regular dividend rate in such a manner as we believe will maintain STRC Stock\u2019s trading price at or close to its stated amount of $100 per share. For example, if the trading price of STRC Stock exceeds $100, our current intention would be to reduce the regular dividend rate with the goal of causing the trading price of STRC Stock to decrease. Similarly, if the trading price of STRC Stock is less than $100, our current intention would be to increase the regular dividend rate with the goal of causing the trading price of STRC Stock to appreciate.

                "Here is the investor presentation, with slides with titles like \u201cBuilding out the Yield Curve for BTC Credit\u201d and \u201cSTRC is Designed to be Stable in Price.\u201d Because Stretch is a perpetual preferred stock, it is in some ways very long-term (perpetual) debt, but because its rate floats every month based on market conditions, it is in some ways like very short-term (monthly) debt. The presentation compares it to other short-term debt instruments:",
                "I suppose the point here is that, compared to, you know, bank accounts, or Treasury bills, Stretch is much smaller, much higher-yielding and, though the presentation doesn\u2019t specifically say this, much weirder.",
                "This obviously demands a certain amount of trust, on the part of investors, in MicroStrategy. If you think \u201csure this thing won\u2019t trade above $100, because then they\u2019d lower the rate, but if it trades below $100 they might be slower to raise the rate,\u201d then you might not want to pay $100 for it. (If it can only go down?) But on the other hand, everything in capital markets demands a certain amount of trust, and everything MicroStrategy does demands a bit more, and MicroStrategy does have a lot of fans.",
                "And because it is essentially in the business of finding weird new sources of capital, it does have incentives to be trustworthy: If this thing trades consistently at $100, people will want to buy whatever it cooks up next; if it doesn\u2019t, they won\u2019t. (The presentation also has a slide titled \u201cOur Preferreds have Outperformed since their IPOs,\u201d which is why Strategy can sell new, weirder preferreds.) Strategy and its investors are all in this together: The more money Strategy makes for investors in its weird securities, the more weird securities it can issue to buy Bitcoin, and that is the business it is in."

Musk offered support for such an investment from his X account earlier this month, but suggested that it wasn\u2019t his decision.\n<end quote>",
                "That\u2019s not how any of this works.

SpaceX has agreed to send some of its money over to xAI, while Musk said, on X, \u201cif it was up to me, Tesla would have invested in xAI long ago\u201d and suggested that there might be a Tesla shareholder vote on doing so. Like an idiot, I took this hypothetical seriously and wrote about what sorts of formalities might be required for Tesla, a public company, to invest its money in one of its chief executive officer\u2019s other projects. (Ideally: A special committee of independent directors would negotiate the investment and then shareholders would vote.) I also wrote:",
                "<start quote>\nOf course if you own Tesla stock it\u2019s not because of cars. \u2026 It\u2019s because you think that Musk is a really good allocator of capital to futuristic endeavors, and Tesla is his only public company, which just happens to be a car company. If Tesla was \u201can index fund for Musk\u2019s futuristic endeavors,\u201d you\u2019d probably be fine with that.\n<end quote>",
                "That is: People own Tesla stock because they want Elon Musk to allocate capital for them. They don\u2019t want to do the capital allocation! They don\u2019t want to submit shareholder proposals telling him what to do! \u201cShareholders are welcome to put forward any shareholder proposals that they\u2019d like\u201d? Come on! Imagine what Musk would say if shareholders actually submitted proposals for what he should do. (Wouldn\u2019t the proposals be, like, \u201cResolved, shareholders would like Elon to spend less time on politics and getting in fights online\u201d?) Shareholders of Elon Musk companies are not in the business of telling Elon Musk what to do with their money. They\u2019re in the business of letting Musk cook with their money.",
                "Also, even apart from the specifics of Elon Musk fandom, this is not how companies are run? A company\u2019s strategy is set by its executives and board of directors, not by shareholder proposals; shareholder proposals are normally nonbinding and cannot \u201cmicromanage\u201d the company\u2019s decisions. If Tesla is going to invest in xAI, ideally shareholders would get a say \u2014 they\u2019d get to vote on the idea \u2014 but the proposal would come from Musk, not from the shareholders. The way for shareholders to vote on it is for Musk to ask them to vote on it, not for them to ask him.",
                "I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on here. But one possibility is that, while Musk does want to pump more money into xAI, and while he does want Tesla shareholders to feel like they are participants in the broader futuristic Musk ecosystem, he doesn\u2019t actually want the constraints that would come from pumping public-company money into xAI. If he proposed it, Tesla probably would want a shareholder vote on it, which might mean public disclosure about xAI\u2019s finances and business plans, and which could mean shareholder lawsuits about disclosure and conflicts of interest and the fairness of the deal. (Though the lawsuits would be in Texas and Tesla would probably win.) It is useful for Musk\u2019s empire to have a big source of public money, but it is also useful for Musk to shield most of that empire from the public markets."

                "2. You get market-moving inside information about a company, in a bad way. Your brother-in-law is an executive at the company and he tells you that it\u2019s about to be acquired at a premium, that sort of thing.",

                "4. Several big multistrategy hedge funds run \u201calpha capture\u201d programs. Basically there\u2019s a website where people \u2014 sell-side analysts, managers of smaller funds, etc. \u2014 can submit trade ideas, and the big hedge fund might use those ideas in its own trading. People who submit good ideas are rewarded, sometimes even if the big fund doesn\u2019t trade on them. For the big hedge fund, the point here is not so much \u201cwe give people a cut of the trades they bring us\u201d and more \u201cwe want people to bring us good ideas, so we pay for good ideas whether or not we trade on them, because in the long term that gets us more good ideas.\u201d It also gives the big fund more data to evaluate which ideas are good. We talked last month about Marshall Wace\u2019s alpha capture program, which treats contributors\u2019 trade ideas as raw inputs to its own quantitative process for finding trades: \u201c\u2018It would be quite wrong to think of it as a simple translation of Joe Schmo\u2019s idea into a portfolio,\u2019 said Marshall. \u2018Joe Schmo may have an idea, and that might be a small part of a signal of whether or not that stock is interesting.\u2019\u201d",

And this is sort of a known problem, so the big funds that do alpha capture try quite hard not to get tips based on inside information, and to document that all of their information is legitimate. Still. One theory is that there is some incentive and opportunity to structure big hedge funds in a way that allows them to (1) trade on inside information but (2) insulate their executives from that information, so that the executives can say \u201chow was I to know that we had inside information?\u201d Letting unsupervised outside randos submit trade recommendations, and using those recommendations indirectly as signals in a quantitative process, might be one way to do that.",

                "<start quote>\nSquarepoint Capital collects ideas for its quant hedge fund from all over the world, with gleaming offices in London, Singapore, Dubai, New York and one above a Paris art gallery near the Champs Elysees. It also paid for stock tips from an Albanian day trader working in a cramped flat on the other side of London that she shared with her brother. Oerta Korfuzi toiled there on a large curved screen in the corner of her living room, squeezed between an alcove and a grey L-shaped sofa. That was until March 24, 2021, when agents from the Financial Conduct Authority arrested Oerta and her brother, Redinel, in a dawn raid. The siblings were convicted of insider trading and money laundering; Redinel, 38, was sentenced to six years in prison this month and Oerta, 36, got five years. Squarepoint, one of the world\u2019s best-known systematic investment funds, wasn\u2019t accused of any wrongdoing, and the Korfuzis\u2019 contributions to Squarepoint weren\u2019t what landed them in jail. It\u2019s not clear whether any of the tips they gave to the fund were based on insider information, or that Squarepoint acted on them. But the episode raises questions about what goes into the black-box process that some of the biggest quant hedge funds use to solicit ideas and help them invest billions of dollars. The Alpha Capture System, as it\u2019s known, seeks \u201csignals\u201d based on vast amounts of data and ideas pitched by thousands of outsiders in exchange for money. A computer-driven algorithmic model converts it all into lucrative trades. There\u2019s nothing illegal about it \u2014 investment firms have used such systems for decades. The hazard, as the Korfuzi trial showed, is that paying rewards might attract people with information they\u2019re not supposed to share, and whose methods and side hustles aren\u2019t always clear. The Korfuzis, for instance, were proffering trading ideas while also stuffing ill-gotten cash from other ventures that didn\u2019t involve Squarepoint into designer bags and transferring money to mysterious recipients in Albania.\n<end quote>",
                "At some level \u201cday-traders stuffing ill-gotten cash into designer bags\u201d really is a differentiated source of alpha: If you have an alpha capture system, your goal is not to just get the same ideas that every other hedge fund analyst has; you want insights from people other funds don\u2019t talk to. At another level it does seem to raise compliance risks."
