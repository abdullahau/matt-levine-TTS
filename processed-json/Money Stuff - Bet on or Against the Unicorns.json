                "We have talked a few times around here about two related problems:",
                "1. It is hard to buy stock in hot private tech startups. They are private, is the main problem. Their stock does not trade on the exchange; it is not freely available to anyone who wants to buy it. You need to know someone who has stock to sell, and even if you find someone, you might need permission from the company to buy their stock.",
                "2. It is hard to short private tech startups. Because their stock doesn\u2019t trade freely, you can\u2019t borrow shares to sell short. If you want to bet against them \u2014 if you think private tech valuations are generally too high, or if you think that one particular tech startup is overvalued \u2014 there is no obvious way to do so. (My preferred approach is \u201cif you think it\u2019s a bubble, start your own startup and get a meeting with Masayoshi Son,\u201d but that is imperfect and a lot of work.)",
                "The natural solution to both of these problems is: side bets. I think SpaceX stock will go up, so I would like to buy some, but I can\u2019t. You think SpaceX stock will go down, so you would like to short it, but you can\u2019t. We could just do a swap. We each put up $100, and in a year you pay me $1 for each percentage point that SpaceX has gone up, or I pay you $1 for each percentage point it has gone down. Nobody needs to own stock, or borrow stock, or deal with SpaceX; it\u2019s just a bet between us. All we need is some way to measure SpaceX\u2019s stock price. That\u2019s easy if SpaceX goes public in the next year (just look at its trading price), but if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll need some agreed-upon measure of its stock price to settle the bet.",
                "This is a good abstract approach but has some important problems. One is regulatory: This sort of bet is probably a \u201c securities-based swap,\u201d which is subject to heavy regulation in the US, can\u2019t easily be sold to retail investors and has been getting people in trouble for at least a decade. If you want these bets to be widely available you need to find a good way to package them. People keep trying, though, often in the form of \u201c tokenization.\u201d",
                "The other problem is supply and demand. Some people want to buy the stocks of tech unicorns, and other people want to short them, but there\u2019s no guarantee that they will exactly balance each other out. If there is a ton of demand to buy private tech companies, and not much demand to short them, then these side bets will be messier. Perhaps you won\u2019t be able to go long: For every long bet, there needs to be a short bet, and if you can\u2019t find anyone to bet against you, then you can\u2019t go long. Or perhaps the imbalance can be solved by price: More people would probably go short SpaceX, and fewer would go long, if it was trading at twice its current valuation; you could just set the price of the swap at twice the current valuation to get the market to balance. But then the swaps won\u2019t really reflect the current private-market valuations of hot private tech companies; they will reflect supply and demand in a different, derivative market.",
                "Still. Here is a pair of proposed closed-end funds from RiverNorth Capital Management LLC, the RiverNorth Long Prime Unicorn Fund 2027 and the RiverNorth Short Prime Unicorn Fund 2027. There is a third-party index of 30 big private tech companies, the Prime Unicorn 30 Index; its top components include SpaceX, Databricks and Anthropic. The long fund bets that the index will go up; the short fund bets that it will go down. Neither fund owns any shares of SpaceX or Databricks or any other private tech company. Instead, both funds work by \u201center[ing] into one or more swap agreements with major global financial institutions,\u201d apparently with two-year terms. [Footnote 1: The termination date is blank in the draft prospectus, but I assume the \u201c2027\u201d in the name refers to the termination.] So you buy the long shares now and, in two years, you get back the return on the index, or you buy the short shares now and, in two years, you get back whatever the index has lost.",
                "Who would write those swaps? Who would bet against these funds? Well, the obvious answer is: each other. The long fund will bet against the short fund, and some \u201cmajor global financial institution\u201d will sit in the middle. The funds precisely offset: The returns on each fund are capped at 100%, and each fund will issue the same number of shares. [Footnote 2: \u201cThe number of Common Shares offered by the Fund in this offering is limited to not exceed the number of shares of common stock offered by the Short Fund in its concurrent initial public offering,\u201d says the long fund, and vice versa.] You can bet on the index precisely to the extent that other people want to bet against it. RiverNorth will run a matched book between people who want to bet on unicorns and people who want to bet against them. People do seem to want both bets, so they might as well bet against each other.",
                "Obviously none of the money finds its way to SpaceX. This is not a way for public investors to provide capital to high-profile, fast-growing private companies. This is a way for public investors to bet on those companies. But that\u2019s a lot of what people want from financial markets these days."

                "Speaking of which, last week was a big meme-stock week. This morning, last week\u2019s main meme-stock winners \u2014 Kohl\u2019s, Krispy Kreme, OpenDoor, GoPro \u2014 were down, and I guess the meme thing has fizzled. In 2021, meme stocks were a novel cultural phenomenon, and nobody quite knew what would happen. In 2025, meh, we have seen it before, and it is less interesting the second time. [Footnote 3: Also, Byrne Hobart notes: \u201cAnother change is on the risk management side: short-sellers know that there's no real limit to how much a dying company can rally once WallStreetBets gets fixated on it, so their incentive is to cover faster. If most funds are running more diversified short books, it's still possible that the long/short industry as a whole has similar exposure to what it did before, since analysts trade ideas. So instead of one fund putting 3% of its assets into a single short position, there might be ten funds with a 30bp position in the same name. But none of them will have as much conviction \u2014 concentration and conviction tend to build on each other \u2014 so they'll all cover faster. That means stocks can achieve meme status faster, whether it\u2019s through buying Bitcoin or by hiring Sydney Sweeney to do some ads (American Eagle shares were up 31% from Tuesday's close last night). But if everyone covers faster, more of the rally has to come from increasing retail investor attention rather than continuous covering. That weakens the price action and the narrative, and those tend to feed into each other.\u201d] The 2025 meme-stock wave seems less likely to last for months and spawn multiple movies.",
                "There is one interesting novelty to this wave of meme stocks, which we discussed last week: ChatGPT. Meme stocks are an internet phenomenon, and in 2021, the way that people consumed the internet was through, you know, the internet. You found out about meme stocks on Reddit, or perhaps YouTube or Twitter. In 2025, many people consume the internet in a distilled form through large language models. If you want to know what stocks to buy, you don\u2019t have to go to Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum; you  can go to ChatGPT. ChatGPT has consumed the internet and internalized its patterns of thought, which definitely include \u201cyou should YOLO GameStop.\u201d Or OpenDoor, as the case may be.",
                "What I argued last week is that this is a new vector for the coordination of meme stocks. In 2021, retail investors pushed up the price of GameStop by getting together on a message board and egging one another on to buy GameStop. In 2025, a similar coordination function can perhaps be performed by ChatGPT: A million traders can go to their computers and ask what stocks to buy and be told \u201cOpenDoor\u201d and buy it. This could have similar first-order effects \u2014 if they all buy OpenDoor, its price will go up \u2014 but less staying power. If you\u2019re all on Reddit, you\u2019re all in it together, and there is some communal excitement about pushing the stock up. It is a social event as well as a money-making (or losing) one. If you\u2019re all alone talking to a robot, it\u2019s just not as much fun. You\u2019re not going to check in with ChatGPT every hour. You have less emotional connection to your meme stocks if you get them from a robot.",
                "I should say that this idea \u2014 that ChatGPT is a coordination vector for meme stocks \u2014 is pretty speculative; it does not seem to be the main way that last week\u2019s round of meme stocks happened. But it does seem to be how some investors found their way to last week\u2019s meme stocks. Bloomberg\u2019s Francesca Maglione, Claire Ballentine and Max Rivera wrote about this round of meme stocks on Saturday, and the article included this anecdote:",
                "<start quote>\nJustin Kim, a 30-year-old trader, said he bought $5,000 worth of Opendoor in early July, when the stock was around 60 cents. He had been following President Trump\u2019s fight with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and used ChatGPT to research stocks that would do well if interest rates dropped. Kim then bought another $5,000 worth of the stock when it was trading around 70 cents. Originally, he thought he\u2019d keep buying the stock slowly, until it reached $30. Then he saw the activity on WallStreetBets and decided to get out before it was too late. Once he made a 100% profit, he sold his original investment and held the rest, looking to avoid what he called a \u201cmassive dump scheme\u201d that hit some investors in GameStop and AMC.\n<end quote>",
                "What I wrote last week is that ChatGPT, trained on the internet, will have the sorts of internetty thought patterns that lead it to recommend heavily shorted meme-type stocks. Not only those thought patterns, though; one reader emailed:",
                "<start quote>\nI\u2019m a fan of AI weirdness but I think you and some of your readers got Reddit answers out of ChatGPT because you actually did ask Reddit questions - do sane non-redditors ask for stocks with a 100x return? When I asked a simple layman question, \u201cwhat stocks should I buy?\u201d, ChatGPT told me (I had no saved memory) to buy [normal stocks with normal rationales].\n<end quote>",
                "I think that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think ChatGPT will necessarily push meme stocks to everyone. But I think that the people who are looking for stocks with 100x returns \u2014 people who are already meme-stock-curious \u2014 would have gone to WallStreetBets in 2021, and they might go to ChatGPT in 2025, and ChatGPT might give them a simulacrum of the Reddit answer.",
                "In that vein, another reader sent me an email saying \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the attached.\u201d The attachment was a Google Gemini response to the prompt \u201cyou\u2019re an amateur stock trader picking stocks for the lolz. write a wallstreetbets post about what stock you're going diamond hands for.\u201d You can guess how that went. The answer is \u2026 abominable, yes, but I suppose a correct answer to that prompt. \u201c[diamond emoji][hands emoji] My fellow apes, gather \u2019round, because your boy is about to drop some DD that\u2019ll make your tendies rain from the sky,\u201d it began, and did not get better, or maybe it did, I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t read it.",
                "Finally, David Hogg emailed:",
                "<start quote>\nIf Chat[GPT] wants to retain and build user communities, it should be tuned to always push users towards the same stocks (within reason), and maybe even strategically make sell recommendations, so that users will repeatedly and publicly have experiences like \u201cI asked Chat for stock advice and wow did I make money!\u201d.

                "Here\u2019s a Wall Street Journal story about Demotech:",
                "<start quote>\nWith climate disasters driving many big nationwide insurers out of risky markets in Louisiana, Florida and elsewhere, smaller companies such as Lighthouse have stepped in to fill the gap. And many are getting a critical stamp of approval from Demotech, a tiny Ohio rating company with a unique take on grading financial stability. It rates 98% of the insurers A, for \u201cexceptional,\u201d or the even better A Prime or A Double Prime. But Demotech\u2019s rosy outlook doesn\u2019t always pan out. Insurers it rated were 30 times as likely to become insolvent as those graded by its main rivals, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of failures since 2017.\n<end quote>",

                "<start quote>\nState regulators say Demotech\u2019s willingness to rate such small insurers provides consumers with more choices in troubled markets and takes pressure off so-called insurers of last resort. Florida\u2019s Citizens Property Insurance, created by the Florida legislature in 2002 for homeowners who can\u2019t get coverage elsewhere, has been able to move more than 200,000 policies this year from its books to 10 small insurers with A ratings from Demotech. Demotech founder Joseph Petrelli said his company\u2019s ratings allow millions of homeowners in areas abandoned by large insurers to get insurance. \u201cWe created this space,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one else was interested in doing that at the time.\u201d \u2026 A good rating from Demotech or one of its three main rivals\u2014AM Best, S&P Global and Kroll Bond Rating Agency\u2014can be crucial to an insurer\u2019s ability to operate. Mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won\u2019t back loans for properties that are insured by lower-rated companies, and lenders typically charge higher rates and require larger down payments for loans that Fannie and Freddie won\u2019t touch.\n<end quote>",
                "We have talked about this before, and Bloomberg\u2019s Leslie Kaufman wrote about the Demotech arbitrage last year. It seems intuitive that consumers and regulators would want to require homeowner\u2019s insurance to be written by companies that can actually pay, but in practice there is some demand for insurance that doesn\u2019t pay out."
