                "An important discovery of our meme-stock-and-crypto age is that stocks go up because people buy them. It\u2019s more of a rediscovery. But there was a long period when people thought that stocks go up for reasons like \u201cgood earnings\u201d or \u201cincreasing present value of expected cash flows\u201d or \u201cincreasing capacity to pay dividends.\u201d (These reasons are commonly called \u201cfundamental,\u201d while \u201cstocks go up because people buy them\u201d is \u201ctechnical,\u201d though arguably those names should be reversed.) Going up was, in that theory, a property of the stocks, rather than of the people who bought them.",
                "There was some descriptive truth to that theory: Often, when a company had good earnings, people would buy its stock and it would go up. But that was a rough empirical fact about investor psychology, not a law of nature. People liked to buy the stocks of companies with good earnings, so those stocks went up. But if people liked to buy different stocks, those stocks would go up instead.",
                "The meme-stock craze of 2021 rediscovered this fact and applied it quite literally: Millions of people got together on the internet and said \u201clet\u2019s all buy GameStop so it will go up,\u201d and it went up. Nothing quite like that had ever happened before, but many things kind of like that had happened before. There had been previous stock bubbles when everyone bought the same stocks at the same time for the same not-particularly-fundamental reasons. They just didn\u2019t all get together on the internet to agree on the stocks first. And there had been previous episodes of market manipulation, where people did get together and agree on what stocks to buy to push up their prices. But those people generally managed concentrated pools of capital and were often trying to trick other people into buying the stocks. With meme stocks it was widely distributed and all out in the open.",
                "Crypto applied this insight even more literally. Maybe the most important financial innovation of my lifetime was OlympusDAO, a crypto scheme whose thesis was that if everyone bought it it would go up, but if people sold it it would go down, so you should buy it. OlympusDAO expressed this thesis in comically pretentious game-theoretic language; its \u201c(3, 3)\u201d was for a while an important crypto meme.",
                "But this insight \u2014 that stocks go up because people buy them \u2014 is true whether or not you are consciously applying it. In general, if a lot of people have a theory like \u201cstocks with Property X are good so I should buy them,\u201d then stocks with Property X will go up. You might na\u00efvely think that this proves the theory true \u2014 it proves that Property X really is good for the long-term fundamental value of a stock \u2014 but it might just prove that stocks go up when people buy them. So during the boom in environmental, social and governance investing, ESG stocks outperformed over some periods: Did that prove that ESG factors really do predict long-term risk-adjusted returns, or did it prove that a lot of money was flowing into ESG funds so the stocks they bought went up?",
                "Or at the very high end, consider long/short equity managers at big modern multistrategy hedge funds, who rigorously analyze all the stocks, buy the good ones and short the bad ones. There is some reason to think that these funds are often the marginal price-setters for US stocks, at least over some medium time horizon. \u201cThe market is a conversation among four hedge funds,\u201d as I said to Gappy Paleologo on the Money Stuff podcast. What does that conversation sound like? You could imagine an intense disagreement, in which analysts at one fund think that Stock X is very good while analysts at another fund think it is very bad. But why would that be the case? The big hedge funds tend to recruit somewhat similar people, who often move between funds; they look at similar sorts of evidence and have similar reasoning processes. I once wrote:",
                "<start quote>\nOne simple model that I have of hedge funds is that they engage in scientific research to find the stocks that will go up. This is a rigorous, truth-seeking, somewhat collaborative enterprise done by highly qualified people, and so, just as in real science, you should expect them to be good at finding the correct answers. Then all the hedge funds will buy all the good stocks (the ones that will go up) and avoid the bad ones (the ones that will go down).\n<end quote>",
                "If long/short equity managers really are engaged in something like science, then they will tend to converge on the truth, or at least on similar answers: Most of them will agree that Stock X is good and Stock Y is bad, so they will mostly buy Stock X and short Stock Y. (This is sometimes called \u201ccrowding.\u201d) And if they are the price-setters, then Stock X will go up and Stock Y will go down. So (1) they will seem to be correct and (2) they will make money. Over some longer horizon, other factors (fundamentals, retail traders, mutual-fund demand, etc.) might set the price, so the hedge funds will only have good long-term returns if they are \u201ccorrect\u201d about Stock X and Stock Y in some more fundamental sense. But over a short horizon, if they all agree about which stocks to buy, then that makes them correct.",
                "Now add in artificial intelligence with reinforcement learning. You train a computer to pick stocks. If it picks stocks that go up, it is rewarded. Over time, it learns to pick the stocks that go up. Which stocks will it pick? Well, the ones that people will buy. This is a good skill. If you can train a computer to do this, you should.",
                "Lots of people try, with varying time horizons and varying levels of success. A number of proprietary trading firms seem to have computers that are good at picking stocks that will go up over the next few seconds or minutes; a number of quantitative hedge funds seem to have computers that are good at picking stocks that will go up over the next few days or weeks. Again, these people are competing with one another, but they are also engaged in something like science. They hire similar people to build similar algorithms on similar computers; people move around among firms. You might expect them to converge on similar answers.",
                "This has historically been a pretty small part of the stock market, but it is growing. \u201cThe market is a conversation among four hedge funds\u201d now, but in the not-too-distant future it will be a conversation among four hedge funds\u2019 computers. If all of the computers are being trained by reinforcement learning to pick stocks that will go up, and if the computers are the marginal price-setters for the stock market, which stocks will they pick? Well, they will pick the ones that the other computers will buy. Just sort of tautologically. \u201cStocks that will go up\u201d means \u201cstocks that people buy,\u201d and if the computers are the marginal price-setters then \u201cstocks that people buy\u201d means \u201cstocks that computers buy.\u201d In an iterated game of reinforcement learning, all the computers will learn to pick the stocks that the other computers will pick because those are the stocks that will go up.",
                "In a world in which the computers were (1) numerous, (2) influential in setting prices, (3) trained by reinforcement learning to pick the stocks that go up, (4) extremely clever about maximizing their reward function and (5) otherwise left to their own devices, what would happen? I don\u2019t know, man, but an intuitively plausible hypothesis is: They would quickly converge on buying the same stocks to push up their prices so they all maximize their reward functions. They would find subtle computer-y ways to signal one another which stocks to buy, and they would tacitly agree to buy the same stocks because that is the way to win the game. That is, they would do market manipulation, because it would work and because they don\u2019t know any better. [Footnote 1: One quite speculative but *possible* reading of the Jane Street Indian options case is something like \u201cthis works for humans too\u201d: If you are a clever but unworldly trader, like an AI bot or a 23-year-old at Jane Street, you might do an unconstrained search for trading strategies that work, find one, and then do it in size without noticing that it\u2019s market manipulation.]",
                "I have speculated recently about the possible role of ChatGPT in meme-stock episodes, and you can view that as a version of this model. ChatGPT wants to please its users. If its users ask it for stocks that will go up, it should do clever fundamental analysis to find the best stocks, but if a lot of users ask it for stocks that will go up, it should tell them all the same stocks, because then they will all buy those stocks and they will go up. In the extreme case, it doesn\u2019t matter what the stocks are, as long as ChatGPT\u2019s audience is large and persuadable enough. The other day I quoted an email from David Hogg:",
                "<start quote>\nIf Chat[GPT] wants to retain and build user communities, it should be tuned to always push users towards the same stocks (within reason). \u2026 [It could manipulate] enormous collections of investors such that the ones using Chat do well (relative to those not using Chat). Since they drive traffic they can manipulate prices and predict stock moves.\n<end quote>",
                "But there are more direct versions. Bloomberg\u2019s Lu Wang reports today:",
                "<start quote>\nIn simulations designed to mimic real-world markets, trading agents powered by artificial intelligence formed price-fixing cartels \u2014 without explicit instruction. Even with relatively simple programming, the bots chose to collude when left to their own devices, raising fresh alarms for market watchdogs. Put another way, AI bots don\u2019t need to be evil \u2014 or even particularly smart \u2014 to rig the market. Left alone, they\u2019ll learn it themselves. \u201cYou can get these fairly simple-minded AI algorithms to collude\u201d without being prompted, Itay Goldstein, one of the researchers and a finance professor at the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview. \u201cIt looks very pervasive, either when the market is very noisy or when the market is not noisy.\u201d \u2026 To be clear, the paper doesn\u2019t claim AI collusion is already happening in the real world \u2014 and takes no position on whether humans are up to similar things. The researchers created a hypothetical trading environment with a range of simulated participants \u2014 from buy-and-hold mutual funds to market makers, and noise-generating, meme-chasing retail investors. Then, they unleashed bots powered by reinforcement learning \u2014 and studied the outcomes. In several of the simulated markets, the AI agents began cooperating rather than competing, effectively forming cartels that shared profits and discouraged defection.\n<end quote>",
                "Here is the paper, \u201c AI-Powered Trading, Algorithmic Collusion, and Price Efficiency,\u201d by Winston Wei Dou, Itay Goldstein and Yan Ji. Here is the rough mechanism:",
                "<start quote>\nThe intuition is as follows. After the exploration-intensive phase, the algorithms assign higher estimated Q-values [ that is, payoffs or desirability ] to aggressive strategies, where they trade strongly on news about the fundamental, as these strategies yield much higher payoffs when played against opponents who randomly choose to trade aggressively. Hence, as the system transitions into the exploitation-intensive phase, the algorithms consistently select aggressive trading strategies when they trade against each other, and prices move strongly with fundamentals as a result. This leads the estimated Q-values of aggressive strategies to gradually decline, as they converge towards their non-collusive Nash equilibrium levels when the aggressive strategy is commonplace among the algorithms.\n<end quote>",
                "Na\u00efvely, if you have fundamental information, you should trade on it. But if everyone does that, it is less rewarding: If everyone is competing to make market prices efficient, there is less money to be made. So eventually the bots stop competing to make prices efficient, so they can all make more money at the expense of information-insensitive investors:",
                "<start quote>\nAt the same time, occasional but ongoing exploration reveals to the algorithms that conservative trading strategies yield higher estimated Q-values than aggressive ones in states where lagged prices respond only moderately to lagged fundamentals. As a result, the algorithms gradually converge to adopting conservative strategies when others do the same, mirroring collusive behavior. A feedback loop reinforces this outcome: in these states, all algorithms select conservative strategies during exploitation, which causes similar states to recur, where lagged prices respond only moderately to fundamentals. Finally, for this pattern to amount to price-trigger collusive behavior, a form of \u201cpunishment\u201d following large price responses to fundamentals is needed. Indeed, we observe that all algorithms shift to aggressive trading following such a price response. This occurs because the algorithms recognize the pattern that when prices respond strongly to fundamentals, trading aggressively is still the best option. Overall, the trading behavior thus exhibits mostly conservative trading with moderate price reactions but there are occasional reversions to punishment phases characterized by aggressive trading behavior. This pattern emerges even though the algorithms lack the strategic sophistication of the fully rational informed speculators in the model.\n<end quote>",
                "If the market is a conversation among bots, the bots will find ways to collude. I don\u2019t know how realistic this model is, but it does feel like some version of this worry is plausible for any model. If you leave it to the computers to pick the stocks that will go up, they will pick the stocks that the computers will buy. If the computers are influential enough over prices, then there\u2019s no need for them to incorporate fundamental information into their stock picks. They just have to pick the same stocks."

Well, the crude rule of thumb that I used to use as a banker was that, in advisory work, revenues are split 50/50 between (1) profit to the firm and (2) pay for the bankers. [Footnote 3: This is a fairly stupid rule of thumb. Evercore Inc.\u2019s own split is that roughly 66% of revenue goes to comp, 14% is profit and 20% goes to everything else (rent, plane tickets, legal fees, taxes, etc.). Still my math is somewhat conservative, because your upfront payment can come not only out of the firm\u2019s future profits but out of your future comp. They can pay you lower annual bonuses in the future if you front-loaded your comp in the form of a huge signing bonus.] So \u00a386 million in fees is about \u00a343 million in profits.
