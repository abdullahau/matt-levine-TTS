                "The big differences between private companies and public companies are:",
                "1. Public companies disclose quarterly financial results and business information; private companies don\u2019t.",
                "2. Anyone can buy shares in public companies on the stock exchange; private companies\u2019 shares don\u2019t generally trade.",
                "Those two things traditionally go together: Public companies can sell stock to anyone because they disclose information to everyone. But that is not an inevitable fact of nature; it is just a somewhat complicated consequence of US securities laws. And I get the sense that it is changing. Specifically, we seem to be getting closer to a world where anyone (or at least a lot of people) can buy shares in private companies (or at least some of the bigger ones), without those companies disclosing any financial information. We have talked about \u201ctokenization,\u201d which I interpret as a sort of Trojan horse for making private-company stocks freely tradable without disclosure. Or there are plans to allow private equity in 401(k) plans, and more generally to offer more private assets to regular investors.",
                "How will regular investors evaluate these investments, if their financials aren\u2019t public? The actual answer is \u201cthey won\u2019t, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d It\u2019s not like most ordinary investors who buy shares of public companies are reading the financial statements and building valuation models. They buy a stock because they like the company and because they assume that the institutional investors whose trading sets the price know what they\u2019re doing. The same thing probably more or less works with big well-known private companies. If you have the chance to invest in OpenAI or SpaceX at the price of its last funding round, I\u2019m not saying you should \u2014 this is not investing advice \u2014 but I am saying that professionals with a lot of money on the line probably put some work into deciding that that price was fine, so that price is probably fine for you. There are many, many, many ways for this to go wrong (\u201cInvest in OppenAI for just $75 per share, big venture capital firms like a15z and Kleinman Parker are scrambling to get in,\u201d your spam folder probably says), but the basic idea \u2014 that market prices are usually efficient enough for amateur investors to rely on \u2014 is mostly fine, even if private companies do not always have \u201cmarket prices\u201d in the ordinary sense.",
                "Still it\u2019s better if the regular investors can log into their broker\u2019s website and read some research telling them what their private companies are worth. Among many other things, Wall Street sell-side research really is a way for ordinary investors to get digestible and forward-looking financial and business information about public companies. Why not private ones? Bloomberg\u2019s Henry Ren reports:",
                "<start quote>\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is expanding research coverage to private companies in the Wall Street bank\u2019s latest effort to capitalize on the rapidly growing field. \u2026 In its first move, the bank launched coverage on OpenAI on Friday. Unlike traditional equity research on public firms, the new offering won\u2019t include ratings, price targets or estimates on private companies, Hussein Malik, JPMorgan\u2019s head of global research, said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. The goal is to provide investor clients with structured information and tracking, he said. \u201cPrivate companies are increasingly pivotal in shaping the growth and outlook of industries,\u201d Malik said in an external note to clients. \u201cUnderstanding their impact is and will remain crucial for both public and private market investors to make informed investment decisions.\u201d\n<end quote>",
                "Right, early on the point here is less \u201cwe are going to build our own financial model of OpenAI, so that our retail clients have some useful information in deciding whether or not to buy OpenAI stock,\u201d and more \u201cwe are going to write generally about OpenAI to inform our clients who might buy Nvidia.\u201d But, at some point, will OpenAI\u2019s chief financial officer be walking JPMorgan\u2019s analysts through the financials, so they can improve their model, so their private-wealth bankers can sell OpenAI stock to customers? It does feel a little bit like that\u2019s where we are heading."

                "A problem for investment banks is that every investment banker wants to be in private equity. This is not, as far as I can tell, because the work of private equity is vastly more interesting than the work of banking. It just pays a lot better.",
                "Typically this problem comes up with regard to very junior investment bankers. The classic career path is that you graduate from college, spend two years as an investment banking analyst, and then leave for private equity. In recent years private equity recruiting has started earlier and earlier, so that by last year bankers interviewed for private equity jobs before even starting their banking jobs. This year banks, led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., have pushed back, and the big private equity firms have held off, for now, from starting \u201con-cycle recruiting\u201d for their 2027 associate class.",
                "But the problem is, if anything, more acute for very senior investment bankers: If you are a top executive at a big investment bank, you make tens of millions of dollars managing a large and complex financial institution, but if you were a top executive at a big alternative asset manager (as the big private equity firms are now called), you could make hundreds of millions of dollars doing that. That\u2019s more!",
                "For an investment bank, there is an obvious unified solution to this problem at all levels, which is: Become a private equity firm. (Sorry, \u201calternative asset manager.\u201d) The boundaries are always a little porous. The main things that investment bankers do are (1) advise companies on mergers and (2) arrange loans for leveraged buyouts; the main things that alternative asset managers do are (1) acquire companies in mergers (private equity) and (2) make loans for leveraged buyouts (private credit); each side intrudes a bit into the other\u2019s turf. Banks have big asset management businesses, including alternative assets like private equity and credit. Just talk more about that and less about the investment banking.",

Chief Executive Officer David Solomon would like to get paid like an alternative asset manager CEO, not an investment bank CEO, because really when you think about it Goldman kind of is an alts manager. \u201cThe board considered the unique competitive threats for talent that Goldman Sachs faces, including from alternative management firms and others beyond the traditional banking sector,\u201d the company told shareholders, adding that Goldman is \u201ca top 5 alternative asset manager.\u201d (Disclosure, I used to work at Goldman, but just as an investment banker.)",
                "And we talked a couple of weeks ago about how Goldman has also told its incoming junior analysts that they are not allowed to accept jobs elsewhere (meaning: in private equity) while working at Goldman. But when you think about it, working at Goldman kind of is like working in private equity. I mean, not quite, if you work in banking, but that can be fixed. Bloomberg\u2019s Jayna Rohslau and Todd Gillespie reported last week:",

For those interested in buy-side careers, Goldman will offer \u201can early entry point,\u201d according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.

                "Do your two years in investment banking at Goldman, and then move into private equity at Goldman, which in case you haven\u2019t heard is an alts manager.",
                "I should say that, when I started working at Goldman in 2007, there were big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co., and there were big private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR, but there was also a third category: investment banks, like Goldman and Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. Goldman in fact did have a big private equity business, and did a lot of investing with its own balance sheet and with customer money, because that was a thing that investment banks did back then. Two legacies of the 2008 financial crisis were that (1) the big investment banks all either became or were acquired by regulated bank holding companies and (2) there were much stricter regulations about the businesses that those banks were allowed to do. And so I write all the time now about how non-banks (alts managers, hedge funds, etc.) are now doing businesses that used to be done by big investment banks, because the big investment banks have become more regulated and conservative.",
                "But Goldman doesn\u2019t have to like it, and that was all a long time ago, and we are in a more permissive and deregulatory age, and if Goldman wants to be an alternative asset manager now sure, why not, give it a try."

This seems to me like a good plan for people who own a lot of crypto, and those people are constantly looking for small public companies to do this trade with.",
                "But there is, I think, another important theory that comes at it from the other direction. What if you own, not a big pot of crypto, but a controlling stake in a meme-stock company? You own a bunch of stock in a company that is worth billions of dollars on the stock market, but for no particular reason. You might worry. \u201cHow long can this last,\u201d you might wonder, and also \u201chow can I turn this meme-y stock into actual money?\u201d Just selling the stock won\u2019t work: If you, the meme-linked controlling shareholder, start dumping your stock, the price will collapse. Non-recourse borrowing seems tough. (Who would lend you the money?) I once proposed donating the stock to get tax benefits, but that has problems too. [Footnote 1: The Internal Revenue Service essentially gives you 37% of the value of your stock (in a tax deduction), which might be better than you could get from a sale or non-recourse loan. But you need a lot of income to shelter, and a charity to donate to, and your donation might tank the stock.]",

                "1. Building a real business is hard!",
                "2. Your meme stock might not work for these purposes. Talented executives and merger targets might significantly discount the meme stock you offer them, and if you sell stock to raise cash, shareholders might get nervous about dilution and the stock price might collapse.",

                "2. The stock won\u2019t crash: Meme-stock shareholders don\u2019t like dilution, but they do love Bitcoin, so selling stock to buy Bitcoin is fine. In fact, selling stock at a premium to buy Bitcoin is clearly accretive to existing shareholders (it\u2019s \u201c accretive dilution \u201d), so they should have no complaints.",
                "3. Now your company owns a lot of Bitcoin.",
                "4. Bitcoin is valuable for reasons that have nothing to do with your meme-y company.",
                "5. So now your company has real enduring value, not because you built any particular business but because you bought a lot of Bitcoin.",
                "6. Now you can go ahead and sell your own stock, or borrow against it: There\u2019s some floor of real asset value; the stock price doesn\u2019t rely solely on memes and confidence. [Footnote 2: You might object that the value of Bitcoin relies solely on memes and confidence, but (1) not everyone agrees and (2) in any case it's exogenous: The value of your Bitcoin doesn't rely on confidence in *you*.]",

If people will buy your stuff for bad reasons, you should sell it to them and use the money to buy real assets, so that one day people will buy your stuff for good reasons.",

But the key element is my No. 2: People will enthusiastically buy your stock if your plan is to increase your Bitcoin per share, but they will have doubts if your plan is to put the money in cash or gold or even a business. Bitcoin is the smooth exit for meme stocks.",

                "It\u2019s possible that my introduction to high finance was reviewing change-of-control clauses. It is a standard part of due diligence in mergers and acquisitions: One company wants to buy another, so the buyer will get a big stack of all the target\u2019s contracts and read through them to see if the merger will cause any problems. Each contract will probably have a clause saying something like \u201cthe company may not transfer its rights and obligations under this contract to anyone else.\u201d And then the question is: If the company is acquired in a merger, does that trigger that clause? Does being acquired count as a transfer of the contract? Or does nothing change?",
                "The normal answer is that nothing changes. (The normal form of merger, in the US, is the \u201creverse triangular merger,\u201d in which a subsidiary of the acquirer merges into the target, leaving the target as the surviving company and wholly owned by the acquirer. Because the target is the surviving company, its contracts should continue uninterrupted: As far as its counterparties are concerned, nothing has happened to the company; it just has different owners.) But different contracts will say different words, and some of those words might sweep up mergers. Each contract will have its own long complicated definitions of terms like \u201ctransfer,\u201d some of which might seem to include mergers.",
                "And so, back in my day, some junior M&A lawyer would have to review all the contracts and make a table of which ones might cause problems in a merger. Nowadays I assume it is done by AI. Back then, it struck me as a weird assignment to give to the junior lawyers: On the one hand, sure, it was incredibly tedious and no senior person would want to do it, but on the other hand, how were the junior lawyers supposed to know? You graduate from law school, you know nothing about mergers, you read some long dense paragraph defining the term \u201cProhibited Transfer,\u201d and, what, you just take a wild guess about whether that includes reverse triangular mergers? How are you supposed to know the nuances of those terms, the things that courts have read into them, the accepted market standards for what they mean?",
                "As I got older, though, I realized that it\u2019s fine because nobody knows. The dispute among Exxon Mobil Corp., Hess Corp. and Chevron Corp. is really incredibly embarrassing for lawyers everywhere. Exxon is the operating partner on a big lucrative oil joint venture in Guyana; Hess owns a non-operating stake, which makes up a big chunk of the total value of Hess. The joint venture agreement, which is not public, contains a right of first refusal: Exxon can buy back Hess\u2019s stake if Hess tries to transfer it. Chevron agreed to buy Hess in a completely straightforward and garden-variety reverse triangular merger. Did that trigger the right of first refusal? Hess and Chevron said no. Exxon said yes, and last year it went to arbitration to try to enforce the right of first refusal.",
                "We talked about it at the time. It seemed to me that, from first principles, Hess really ought to be able to keep the JV. I wrote:",

                "Still, first principles only get you so far; I didn\u2019t know what the agreement said (and still don\u2019t), and I certainly didn\u2019t know what it meant.

This appeared to support Chevron and Hess\u2019s case because the Guyana stake would still be held by Hess\u2019s Guyana unit, even if that would now be controlled by Chevron.\n<end quote>",
                "That seems to have been basically right: The Chevron/Hess deal is a reverse triangular merger in which Hess survives as a subsidiary of Chevron, so it hasn\u2019t transferred its joint venture stake, so there\u2019s no transfer and so no right of first refusal. Fairly straightforward, but it took almost two years. Anyway:",
                "<start quote>\nThe ruling announced Friday by the International Chamber of Commerce in favor of Hess and Chevon eliminates the concern that contracts used for partnerships like the one for Guyana\u2019s giant oil field could be used to \u201cpeel assets out of a corporate level transaction,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. That\u2019s important for an industry where deal making is vital to success, Wirth said. \u201cWe have companies that come into this industry and people who build them, and the way they get rewarded is selling the company,\u201d Wirth said on the heels of a career-defining acquisition. \u201cIt is in the nature of our industry that transactions are part and parcel with how it functions.\u201d\n<end quote>",
                "Again, I sympathize: It can\u2019t really be the intention of oil-and-gas joint venture agreements to prevent mergers. But you\u2019d think they could say that more clearly."
