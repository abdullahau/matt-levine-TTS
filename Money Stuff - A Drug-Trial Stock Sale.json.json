                "Here’s a weird little trade, first reported by Adam Feuerstein of StatNews. INmune Bio Inc. is a biotechnology company working on treatments for cancer and Alzheimer’s Disease. It recently conducted a Phase 2 trial of an Alzheimer’s drug called XPro. It... didn’t work, is the short summary (“ showing no effects in the modified intent-to-treat population”), though there is some good news (“predefined analyses demonstrated a cognitive benefit for XPro over placebo on the primary endpoint”), and I do not want to give you any investing or medical advice. But INmune got these results last week, and it seems safe to say they were not what it was hoping for.",
                "As a small biotech company, INmune is not exactly awash in cash. As of March, it had about $19 million of cash and was spending about $3 million a month. A little more money might be nice, and for a small biotech company the way to get a little more money is to sell stock. Ideally the way to do this would be (1) get good trial results, (2) announce those results, (3) stock goes up, (4) sell stock into that demand. That option was not available, because the trial results were bad.",
                "That left some unappealing options. INmune could announce the results, watch the stock go down, and sell stock into a lack of demand. It couldn’t really sit on the trial results: If it sold stock, it would need to publish a prospectus describing all the material facts about the company, and its lawyers would probably make it put the results in the prospectus. And then people would read the prospectus and the stock would go down.",
                "There is, however, a tiny loophole of sorts. What INmune actually did was:",
                "1. At 4 p.m. on Thursday, June 26, it put out a press release saying that it would “host a conference call on Monday, June 30 beginning at 8:00am EDT to present top line data from the Phase 2 MINDFuL trial in early Alzheimer’s Disease.” Not saying the results, mind you, just saying that it would deliver the results on Monday.",
                "2. The stock traded up: Investors read that press release and thought “ooh, an announcement of trial results, probably they’re good.” The stock hit a high of $11.64 per share at 10:47 a.m. on Friday, June 27.",
                "3. On Friday morning, INmune agreed to sell $18.9 million of stock to “two healthcare focused institutional investors,” at a price of $6.30 per share, 2 cents above the $6.28 closing price of the stock on Thursday.",
                "4. On Friday at 12:16 p.m Bloomberg Terminal., it announced the stock sale publicly.",
                "Because the stock offering was a privately negotiated deal with two sophisticated investors, INmune didn’t have to tell them the trial results: The investors signed a “big boy” representation acknowledging that the company had material nonpublic information that it wasn’t sharing with them. The purchase agreement said:",
                "<start quote>\nEach Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the Company is in possession of top line data from the Phase 2 MINDFuL trial in early Alzheimer’s Disease (the “Phase 2 Trial Results”) and has announced that it will host a conference call on June 30, 2025 to present such Phase 2 Trial Results; (ii) the Phase 2 Trial Results constitutes material non-public information that could adversely impact the price of the Securities; and (iii) such Purchaser desires to proceed with the purchase of the Securities under this Agreement notwithstanding such pending Phase 2 Trial Results.\n<end quote>",
                "Why would the investors do this? If the clinical results are bad, the stock will trade down to, say, $2. (It hit a low of $1.89 this morning.) If the results are good, it will trade up to, say, $15. In a vacuum, you might say “I think the chances of good results are 50/50, so paying $6.30 for the stock is a good trade.” But you wouldn’t do that trade with the company. The company knows the results! If the results are good, the company will announce them and sell stock at $15. If the company is selling stock to you at $6.30, you can guess that the results are bad.",
                "But there is a better answer. The investors can buy the stock and resell it immediately. The offering was a “ registered direct ” offering: Even though it was sold only to two institutions, it was structured as a public offering, INmune filed a prospectus, and the two investors got immediately tradeable stock. They also had no material nonpublic information: INmune knew the trial results, but the investors did not. They could just sell their stock whenever they wanted. [Footnote 1: Feurstein reports: “The funds immediately flipped (sold) the stock — instant profit.”]",
                "On Friday morning, the stock was trading well above the $6.30 purchase price. Then the stock sale was announced and the stock started falling — it closed at $5.33 on Friday — but, still, the investors had a decent chance to get out at a profit. [Footnote 2: Just for fun, I looked at INMune’s trading activity between 12:16 p.m. (the time stamp I see on the offering press release) and 12:46 p.m. on Friday, June 27. Bloomberg (page INMB US Equity AQR) shows me that 6.2 million shares traded in that half-hour window, at a volume-weighted average price of $6.68. The investors bought 3 million shares at $6.30. Could they have gotten out of all of it at a profit in that half hour? Seems like a lot (they’d be 50% of volume), but not completely impossible. Total trading on Friday was 59.9 million shares (the company normally trades fewer than 1 million shares per day), so selling 3 million shares over the course of the day was totally possible. Also the purchase agreement specifically says that “none of the Purchasers has been asked by the Company to agree, nor has any Purchaser agreed, to desist from purchasing or selling, long and/or short, securities of the Company” and that “any Purchaser … presently may have a ‘short’ position in the Common Stock.” So it is possible that the investors sold the stock short *before* they agreed to buy it.] (Why did the stock fall when the stock offering was announced? Presumably some combination of (1) everyone did the calculation I did above, which is that the company wouldn’t be selling at $6.30 if the results were good, and (2) if the investors in the offering were selling, that would drive down the price. [Footnote 3: Plus “dilution,” which I suppose is always a worry in stock offerings for small companies.] )",
                "This doesn’t seem like that much of a loophole: It was a registered offering, INmune had to file a prospectus, it did file a prospectus, and the prospectus had to (and did) include the disappointing trial results. From the prospectus:",
                "<start quote>\nOn June 30, 2025, the Company announced topline results from its Phase 2 MINDFuL trial evaluating XPro for early AD. The trial did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints in the modified intent-to-treat population (n=200). However, in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with amyloid-positive AD and multiple inflammatory biomarkers (n=100), XPro demonstrated cognitive and biomarker benefits, including improvements on EMACC and NPI-12, and reductions in plasma pTau217 and GFAP.\n<end quote>",
                "But the prospectus is dated Monday, June 30: The investors bought the stock, and possibly sold it, before the prospectus was published. INmune, like many US public companies, has a “ shelf registration statement,” allowing it to do public stock offerings quickly. It could sell the stock to the registered direct investors, and they could resell it, using that generic registration statement. It just had to deliver an updated prospectus — describing the actual offering, and disclosing the trial results — before the offering closed: INmune couldn’t take the investors’ money, or give them stock, without delivering a prospectus, but it could agree to the trade before that. The closing is T+1 (one trading day after the offering), so Monday for a Friday offering. Technically INmune delivered the stock to the investors on Monday, along with a prospectus, but by that time they could already have sold it. [Footnote 4: Regular-way stock trades also settle T plus 1, so on Friday the investors could have sold the stock, even though they didn’t have it yet.]",
                "This is a small, weird, occasionally lucrative niche in the capital markets. Sometimes a company cannot do a public offering of stock directly to retail investors, because it would create too much embarrassment and/or legal liability. But it can find an intermediary, some investment firm that will buy its stock and immediately turn around to sell it to the public, interposing some complication to save the company from the awkwardness. (The classic case that we have discussed around here is Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.) Here, INmune probably couldn’t have sold stock directly to the public, but it could sell stock indirectly to the public, [Footnote 5: Not legal advice! One could raise objections; this does seem a bit unsporting to the people who bought stock on Friday.] and it did."
            ],
            "summary": "INmune Bio, a biotechnology company, faced a difficult situation after its Alzheimer's drug, XPro, yielded disappointing results in a Phase 2 trial. Needing to raise cash but unable to sell stock into an expected market downturn following bad news, the company employed an unconventional strategy. It first announced a future conference call to discuss results, which temporarily caused its stock to rise as investors anticipated good news. During this brief window, INmune Bio conducted a \"registered direct offering,\" selling nearly 19 million dollars worth of stock to two \"healthcare focused institutional investors\" at a price well below the current market high but above its previous day's close.\n\nThis \"weird little trade\" highlights a niche in capital markets where companies navigate challenging financial situations and information asymmetry. The core theme revolves around how a company with material nonpublic information (the bad trial results) can still raise capital from sophisticated investors who, through a \"big boy\" representation, acknowledge they are proceeding with the purchase despite the undisclosed potentially negative data. These institutional investors, not bound by the same non-disclosure constraints as the company, could then immediately \"flip\" or resell the stock for a quick profit before the official public announcement of the trial results caused the share price to plummet.\n\nThe broader context illustrates how small, cash-strapped biotech firms, which typically spend around 3 million dollars a month, can exploit regulatory timing and market structures. The ideal scenario for a stock sale—announcing good news, watching the stock rise, then selling—was unavailable to INmune. Instead, they leveraged their existing \"shelf registration statement\" to quickly execute a public offering to these private institutional buyers. Although a prospectus, which details an investment offering and ultimately included the disappointing Phase 2 trial results, had to be filed, it was dated for the Monday after the Friday stock sale. This timing, combined with the \"T+1 settlement\" for stock trades, meant the investors could potentially sell their shares even before the full negative disclosure was widely available, protecting their investment. This maneuver is described as possibly \"unsporting\" to the general public who bought shares without this crucial information.\n\nFinancial terms central to understanding this situation include the \"Phase 2 trial\" itself, which assessed the drug's efficacy in a \"modified intent-to-treat population\" compared to a \"placebo.\" The trial's findings mentioned \"cognitive benefit\" on the \"primary endpoint\" in a specific subgroup, along with changes in \"biomarkers\" like pTau217 and GFAP, and improvements on assessment tools like EMACC and NPI-12, though overall results were negative. The transaction involved a \"prospectus\" and understanding the implications of \"material nonpublic information.\" The investors' potential strategy included taking a \"short position\" in the stock. The author also briefly mentions \"dilution\" as a general concern in stock offerings for small companies. This complex sequence of events showcases the intricate dance between corporate finance, investor sophistication, and market disclosure rules."

                "It used to be that most big well-known companies were public, but that is not as true anymore. Now a lot of big exciting tech companies — SpaceX, Stripe, OpenAI, etc. — are private, which means that you can’t just buy them by clicking a button in your brokerage account. You need to know somebody. A lot of people want to buy shares in big exciting private tech companies, but it is hard for them to do so.",
                "Also, the fact that these companies are private means that, if you do own some shares, you can’t just sell them by clicking a button in your brokerage account. You have to find someone to buy. Even though there is a lot of demand for these shares, it can be hard to cash out.",
                "One way to put this is that the bid/ask spread on private shares is really wide, particularly for individual investors without direct access to the companies. If some hot private company’s stock is “really” worth $50 per share, and you want to buy some, you might have to pay $70. And then if you want to sell, you might get only $40.",
                "We talk about this dynamic all the time. We talked about it last week, because a crypto-y company is offering “tokens” on private-company stocks to, uh, possibly increase the supply. In December, we discussed a company offering SpaceX shares through a special purpose vehicle at roughly a 100% markup to the actual trading price of the shares: Institutions were buying SpaceX at $135 per share, but if you wanted in on that SPV, you’d pay $258. Even that seemed pretty tame compared with DXYZ, the Destiny Tech100 fund, a closed-end fund that owns about $70 million of private-company stocks and has a market value of about $400 million; when we first discussed DXYZ, it traded at more than a 1,000% markup to the value of its underlying shares.",
                "Each time I discuss these things, I get emails from readers saying “actually my broker is offering me SpaceX shares at a very reasonable markup.” I am sure that’s true. The point here is not that retail investors will always pay an enormous markup for SpaceX shares. The point here is that retail investors will pay an enormous range of markups for SpaceX shares: Some will pay 0%, some will pay 5%, some will pay 100%, some will pay 1,000%. There is not a simple single “market price” for private-company shares, the way there is for public-company shares. People can sell you private-company shares at pretty much whatever price you are willing to pay.",
                "Here’s a Wall Street Journal article about Linqto, a company that “said it would make private equity investing easy, and ‘democratize’ the rarefied private markets.” If someone in finance tells you that they are going to “democratize” anything, hold on to your wallet. Basically Linqto’s business model was (1) acquiring shares of hot private companies and then (2) selling them to retail-ish [Footnote 6: The legal situation is that, for the most part, you can only sell private-company shares to “accredited investors,” meaning people who make at least $200,000 a year or have a net worth of more than $1 million. This is not all that high a bar, and I think it is fair to call Linqto’s customers “retail-ish.” But also there are some exceptions to those rules, and Linqto did manage to find ways to sell private-company shares to non-accredited investors. The Journal reports: “The company even allowed some people who weren’t accredited investors to participate in the deals. Among them was Thomas Lennon, 33, who in September 2024 invested $10,000 in Ripple — the minimum amount for a promotion offering investment ‘slots’ to 35 who weren’t accredited, he said.” (I assume the structure here is an SPV owning Ripple shares, with the SPV doing a Rule 506 offering to no more than 35 non-accredited investors.)] investors at enormous markups:",
                "<start quote>\nIn January 2023, the chief executive of the private stock investment firm Linqto announced a “Spike Day,” a one-day sprint to boost sales to its customers—small investors looking for a shot at buying shares of coveted private companies. “Take no prisoners,” the now-former CEO, William Sarris, wrote in an email to staff, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. “This is guerrilla warfare.” Sarris was trying to unload shares of Ripple, a privately held crypto company, to Linqto’s 11,000 users, at a price at least 60% higher than what Linqto paid. The Securities and Exchange Commission generally prohibits markups above 10% but Sarris pushed ahead, not disclosing the price hike to customers, and the company pocketed $2 million, according to people close to the situation.\n<end quote>",
                "Well, for a normal brokerage firm, buying stock and then reselling it to customers at a 60% markup would be quite high, but in the context of the 100% or 1,000% private-company markups we talk about around here, it’s not that surprising. Meanwhile, the nature of the business is such that there will be fewer cases of the broker buying from customers at too low a price — mostly the customers want to keep their exciting private stocks — but not none:",
                "<start quote>\nLinqto didn’t just profit from selling shares of private companies to users. Sometimes the deals went the other direction. At the end of 2023, Linqto learned that Ripple, which remains private, was preparing to buy back shares from customers at roughly $61 each. Linqto reached out to customers, who were in the black on their Ripple investments, and convinced them to sell 144,000 shares of Ripple back to the company at an average of $55 per share, according to people close to the situation. It then sold them all to the crypto company at the higher offering price, booking more than $8 million in revenue.\n<end quote>",

            ],
            "summary": "This section of a Bloomberg newsletter explains the significant challenges of investing in shares of prominent private companies like SpaceX, Stripe, and OpenAI, which are not accessible via standard brokerage accounts. It highlights how the lack of a transparent market for these illiquid assets leads to a vast and inconsistent range of markups for buyers and difficulties for sellers trying to cash out. This opacity creates an environment where intermediaries can exploit high demand, often selling shares at exorbitant premiums.\n\nThe central themes revolve around the illiquidity and opaque pricing of private company shares, contrasted with the regulated transparency of public markets. The author maintains a skeptical and cautionary tone, particularly when discussing firms that claim to \"democratize\" private equity, implying such claims often precede exploitation. The piece illustrates that while a simple \"market price\" exists for publicly traded stocks, no such single price point exists for private shares, allowing sellers to charge whatever buyers are willing to pay. This dynamic is exacerbated by firms like Linqto, which aggressively sold shares of private companies such as Ripple at markups far exceeding typical brokerage norms, in one case as high as sixty percent to retail-ish investors. They also profited by buying shares back from investors at a discount and reselling them quickly at a higher price.\n\nThe broader context is the current investment landscape where many desirable companies choose to remain private for longer, creating a bottleneck for retail access to their growth. The article underscores a recurring problem the author has discussed, referencing prior instances of extreme markups, including a special purpose vehicle for SpaceX shares at a one hundred percent premium and the Destiny Tech100 fund, a closed-end fund, trading at over a thousand percent markup to its underlying assets. Notable financial terms include the bid-ask spread, which describes the wide gap between buying and selling prices in illiquid markets; the use of special purpose vehicles, which are entities created to facilitate investments in private assets; and the concept of \"accredited investors,\" individuals deemed financially sophisticated enough for certain investments, though the author notes many customers of these platforms fall into a \"retail-ish\" category, sometimes even circumventing the rules via structures like Rule 506 offerings. The Securities and Exchange Commission is referenced in relation to brokerage markup limits, which were seemingly ignored by firms like Linqto. The underlying insight is that in the unregulated private market, intermediaries can take significant cuts when facilitating transactions, both when buying from and selling to individual investors."

(In the US, it often stands for “synthetic risk transfer,” while in Europe it normally stands for “significant risk transfer.” [Footnote 7: To me “synthetic” sounds more descriptive (you are transferring risk synthetically, that is, through a derivative), but “significant” in Europe refers to a specific regulatory test: You can reduce your capital requirements if the risk transfer is significant enough.] ) The rough idea of an SRT is:",

                "2. Those loans are somewhat risky, and regulators will require the bank to have a lot of regulatory capital in case they don’t get paid back.",
                "3. But the bank can sell the first-loss piece to a hedge fund or other investor. The bank sets up a structure where the first $850 million of repayments, on the whole pool of loans, goes to the bank; the remaining $150 million goes to the hedge fund. If there are defaults and only $925 million of the loans actually get paid back, the hedge fund only gets $75 million, but the bank still gets its full $850 million.",
                "4. The first-loss piece gets packaged into a bond, which the bank sells to the hedge fund for $150 million, and the bank pays, say, 10% interest on that bond. (That is: The bank gets $60 million of annual interest on the whole loan portfolio, 6% of $1 billion, and pays $15 million of interest, 10% of $150 million, to the hedge fund.)",
                "5. The hedge fund takes more risk than the bank (it has the first loss), and it gets more reward (it gets a higher interest rate).",
                "6. The bank gets better capital treatment from its regulators: Instead of holding, say, $80 million of capital against the whole portfolio, the bank can hold, say, $8 million of capital against the much safer $850 million senior piece. The bank’s cost of equity capital is higher than 10%, so paying the hedge fund to reduce capital requirements can be a good deal for the bank.",
                "There are variations on the structure, and the numbers here are illustrative and not meant to be taken seriously. [Footnote 8: Here are primers on the structure from the European Systemic Risk Board, A&O Shearman and the Managed Funds Association.] The point is just that the hedge fund takes the first loss, the bank takes the second loss, and this is a very common theme in modern banking. Banks are “re-tranching”: They are stepping back from taking certain economic risks (like making corporate loans), letting other players (hedge funds, private credit firms, etc.) take those risks, while the banks provide financing to those other players and take a more senior claim on the risks.",
                "There are various more-or-less economically equivalent ways to structure that tranching. In the abstract, the SRT looks something like “the hedge fund makes a $1 billion pool of loans, and the bank lends the hedge fund $850 million of non-recourse leverage collateralized by those loans.” It’s not quite set up that way — in part because the hedge fund doesn’t have the corporate relationships required to originate those loans — but economically that is roughly the same thing as the SRT. (And in fact, elsewhere, private credit firms do have the relationships required to originate corporate loans, and they do, and banks lend them money against their loans, though usually not at 85% loan-to-value ratios.)",
                "And then there are some funds that are in the business of buying these SRTs, so some hedge fund will buy $150 million of this SRT and $100 million of another SRT and end up with a $2 billion portfolio of SRTs. And then, being a hedge fund, it will think: “I have this big $2 billion pot of assets. It’s a pretty good pot of assets: Sure, it’s first-loss pieces of corporate loans, but it’s diversified, and the loans were made by big banks to good companies, so they’ll probably mostly get paid back. Perhaps someone would lend me, say, $1 billion against this portfolio. I’d take the first loss — if $500 million of the SRTs don’t get paid back, I’ll lose $500 million and my lender will still get its $1 billion back — so the lender should feel pretty safe. And I can pay my lender a lower interest rate on the loan than I get on the SRTs, so I can juice my return on equity.”",
                "And the hedge fund will call some banks, and one of them will probably give it that loan. Ideally not one of the banks that issued the SRTs, though. It is arguably a little awkward for a bank to sell its credit risk to the hedge fund (via SRT) and also finance that trade.",
                "Arguably it’s a little awkward anyway. Bloomberg reports:",

Regulators want to ensure that risk is actually leaving the system when banks use significant risk transfers, or SRTs, to free up capital while keeping the assets on their balance sheets. “We’ve been asking for more transparency, more reporting information,” Jose Manuel Campa, who leads the European Banking Authority, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Monday in London. “Potentially you get a vicious circle by which a bank sells protection to somebody that’s been financed by another bank.”\n<end quote>",
                "“Banks Transfer Risk to Themselves,” is how I characterized the concern last year. SRT structures tend to be driven by regulation: The bank sells enough risk to the hedge fund to get the capital relief it wants; the regulator says, in effect, “if you sell the 15% first-loss piece and keep the rest then you get to have less capital.” If a bank then goes and lends 50% against the first-loss piece, then the banks collectively have 92.5% of the risk and the hedge fund has only a 7.5% first-loss piece, [Footnote 9: This isn’t quite right, to the extent that the financing of the SRT might have margin triggers and create less economic exposure than a long-term loan at 50% LTV.] and that can look like cheating."
            ],
            "summary": "This section describes a financial product known as an SRT, or Significant Risk Transfer, which allows banks to reduce their regulatory capital requirements by effectively selling the riskiest, or first-loss, portion of a loan portfolio to investors like hedge funds. The author then highlights a critical regulatory concern where banks might inadvertently bring this risk back into the financial system by lending money to the very hedge funds that purchased these SRTs, creating a circular flow of risk that regulators are now scrutinizing for transparency.\n\nThe main topics discussed include the mechanics and purpose of SRTs, the role of hedge funds and private credit in absorbing financial risk, how banks use these structures for capital optimization, and a broader trend where banks are shifting from primary risk-takers to financiers of other entities. A significant theme is the emerging regulatory concern that this intricate web of transactions could undermine the intended goal of risk transfer, potentially leading to a \"vicious circle\" where risk remains within the banking system collectively.\n\nThe tone is informative and slightly informal, using illustrative numbers and injecting a touch of humor by noting the inconsistent naming of SRTs. The author's commentary suggests a skeptical view on the effectiveness of risk transfer when banks end up financing the buyers of that risk, implying a form of \"cheating\" on regulatory requirements.\n\nThe broader context of this passage suggests it is part of a larger discussion on modern banking practices and financial innovation in response to regulation. It illustrates how financial products like SRTs enable banks to manage their balance sheets and capital ratios, but also how these complex arrangements can lead to new forms of systemic risk or regulatory arbitrage. The article implies that while banks aim to shed certain economic risks, they are simultaneously evolving into providers of financing for other market participants who do take on those risks, a process the author calls \"re-tranching.\"\n\nSeveral financial terms are notable: SRT, which confusingly stands for \"significant risk transfer\" in Europe and \"synthetic risk transfer\" in the US; \"first-loss piece,\" referring to the riskiest portion of an asset pool that absorbs initial losses; \"regulatory capital,\" the amount of capital banks must hold as a buffer against risks; \"hedge fund,\" a type of investment fund that engages in a wide range of investment activities; and \"non-recourse leverage,\" a loan where the borrower's personal assets are not at risk, only the collateral. The concept of \"re-tranching\" is also central, describing how banks are restructuring risks. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is mentioned as a key regulator pushing for more transparency in these arrangements."

                "In the slightly more distant future, the WGL will be put together by the AIs, and it will only have contact information for the AIs, and it won’t have to be a nicely formatted PowerPoint because only the AIs will read it.",

                "2. Entirely AI-native workflows replace the normal banking workflows, so instead of a bunch of principals and banks and law firms getting together to negotiate a merger, corporations will, you know, be autonomous entities that combine and split without any human interference.",
                "But the path I laid out above — in which banking processes look kind of like they do now, except that a lot of the actual bankers are replaced by lightly anthropomorphized AI assistants who sometimes deal with humans and sometimes deal with other AIs — has a certain creepy appeal. You sort of know what that AI assistant is; it fits into familiar categories. It’s an assistant, a junior banker, something like that. (Over time, it gets promoted: It’s a midlevel banker, a senior banker, a bank CEO.) You can’t hang out with the AI banker in the analyst bullpen; it can’t make small talk with the client over drinks. But you’re probably mostly communicating by chats and emails anyway, and the AI assistant is good enough at that.",

                "<start quote>\nSimilar to human employees, these digital workers have direct managers they report to and work autonomously in areas like coding and payment instruction validation, said [Bank of New York Mellon] Chief Information Officer Leigh-Ann Russell. Soon they’ll have access to their own email accounts and may even be able to communicate with colleagues in other ways like through Microsoft Teams, she said. … BNY said it took three months for its AI Hub to spin up two digital employee personas: one designed to clean up vulnerabilities in code and one designed to validate payment instructions. Each persona can exist in a few dozen instances, and each instance is assigned to work narrowly within a particular team, Russell said.\n<end quote>",

                "<start quote>\nAt JPMorgan Chase, Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron thinks of “digital employees” as more of a helpful model for business people to conceptualize AI tools. They are fundamentally different from human employees, of course, but also traditional software systems, and so they may need their own type of system connectivity and access management, he said. It’s an open question exactly how much or how little access to give an agent, and it’s going to have to be figured out on a case-by-case basis, he said. And while it’s not clear yet exactly what it will look like, he does envision a future where every employee will have an AI assistant and every client experience will have an AI concierge.\n<end quote>",
                "At some fairly abstract level, the job of an investment banker or salesperson is to be a concierge for certain categories of client experiences. If there’s an AI concierge for every client experience … you know what, never mind. Elsewhere: “Amazon Is on the Cusp of Using More Robots Than Humans in Its Warehouses.”"

            "summary": "The author speculates with humorous and slightly unsettling overtones about artificial intelligence transforming investment banking, envisioning a future where AI assistants gradually take over core deal-making tasks from compiling contact lists to negotiating entire transactions, effectively replacing human bankers. This progression could lead to humans merely \"going to the beach\" while their AI counterparts manage deals. The main topics explored are the various ways AI could integrate into banking, ranging from being mere background tools to fully autonomous \"digital employees,\" and the implications this has for human roles and client interactions within the financial sector. The piece carries a wry, speculative tone, marked by a blend of humor and a sense of inevitable, almost creepy, progression as AI systems become increasingly anthropomorphized and capable.\n\nThe broader context is a commentary on the accelerating automation within financial services, a common theme in Bloomberg's Money Stuff column, which often uses a speculative and satirical lens to explore industry trends. The author, Matt Levine, uses a seemingly mundane investment banking step – the creation of a working group list – to launch into a discussion about AI's potential to redefine the very nature of deal-making and human employment in finance. The article-level insight is that AI isn't just an efficiency tool; it has the potential to become a direct substitute for human labor, even in complex, client-facing roles, challenging traditional definitions of employment and client service.\n\nNotable financial terms and references include \"investment banking deal,\" \"working group list\" or WGL, \"data room,\" \"analyst bullpen,\" \"principals,\" \"bankers,\" \"lawyers,\" and \"accountants,\" all standard participants in large transactions. The text also mentions prominent financial institutions like Bank of New York Mellon and JPMorgan Chase, which are actively exploring \"digital employees\" or AI personas to perform tasks like code cleaning and payment instruction validation. The concept of an \"AI concierge\" is introduced, directly challenging the traditional role of an investment banker or salesperson in client service. The Wall Street Journal is referenced as a source for industry news on these developments, and Amazon is briefly mentioned as an example of a company already heavily reliant on automation in its operations."

                "<start quote>\nOver the weekend, Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI sent an internal memo saying that he felt “as if someone has broken into our home and stolen something” following recent staff departures. OpenAI has given staff the week off to rest and recharge, according to people close to the company. Chen added that Meta was trying to “take advantage” of the planned break to pressure employees to make decisions on job offers.\n<end quote>",

They are so exhausted by getting offered so much money that they need a week off to hike, watch television, and not think about all the money Meta is offering them? And Meta is trying to “take advantage” of that break by, you know, scheduling interviews with them during that week? That does seem … pretty obvious and predictable? Anyway, I also wrote yesterday that “the AI researchers have vast reservoirs of intrinsic motivation that I cannot begin to imagine (they just love AI so much),” and the FT article also gets into that:",
                "<start quote>\nResearchers often prioritise the reputation of team leaders and the quality of work over the huge sums of cash being offered, according to AI recruiters. Researchers are “incentivised by the type of work they’re doing.

                "One possibility is that Meta is the extremely cushy semi-retirement home for OpenAI researchers: You do good work at OpenAI, you make a name for yourself, and then when you get tired you take Zuckerberg’s bag of cash, go to Meta, and sit around with your fellow extremely well-paid ex-OpenAI researchers reminiscing about the glory days when you used to do AI research instead of just polishing your Ferraris."

            "summary": "The section humorously details the intense talent war in the artificial intelligence sector, specifically Meta's aggressive recruitment of staff from OpenAI. It highlights the author's incredulous take on OpenAI researchers needing a week off due to being overwhelmed by job offers, and Meta's seemingly predictable move to exploit this break for recruitment. The main topics are the fierce competition for AI talent, the prioritization of work quality and team reputation over vast financial incentives, and the potential for burnout in the high-stakes AI industry.\n\nThe tone is notably sarcastic and questioning, especially regarding the idea of AI researchers being \"exhausted by getting offered so much money\" and the humorous suggestion that Meta serves as a \"cushy semi-retirement home\" where former top researchers might just \"polish their Ferraris\" instead of continuing groundbreaking work. The broader context reveals the cutthroat nature of the AI talent market, where major players like OpenAI, Meta, DeepMind, and Anthropic are vying for the best minds. Notable financial references include \"sack of money,\" \"huge sums of cash,\" and the implication of being \"well-paid,\" underscoring the extreme compensation levels involved in attracting these specialized professionals."
