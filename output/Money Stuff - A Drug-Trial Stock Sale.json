                "Here\u2019s a weird little trade, first reported by Adam Feuerstein of StatNews. INmune Bio Inc. is a biotechnology company working on treatments for cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. It recently conducted a Phase 2 trial of an Alzheimer\u2019s drug called XPro. It... didn\u2019t work, is the short summary (\u201c showing no effects in the modified intent-to-treat population\u201d), though there is some good news (\u201cpredefined analyses demonstrated a cognitive benefit for XPro over placebo on the primary endpoint\u201d), and I do not want to give you any investing or medical advice. But INmune got these results last week, and it seems safe to say they were not what it was hoping for.",
                "As a small biotech company, INmune is not exactly awash in cash. As of March, it had about $19 million of cash and was spending about $3 million a month. A little more money might be nice, and for a small biotech company the way to get a little more money is to sell stock. Ideally the way to do this would be (1) get good trial results, (2) announce those results, (3) stock goes up, (4) sell stock into that demand. That option was not available, because the trial results were bad.",
                "That left some unappealing options. INmune could announce the results, watch the stock go down, and sell stock into a lack of demand. It couldn\u2019t really sit on the trial results: If it sold stock, it would need to publish a prospectus describing all the material facts about the company, and its lawyers would probably make it put the results in the prospectus. And then people would read the prospectus and the stock would go down.",
                "There is, however, a tiny loophole of sorts. What INmune actually did was:",
                "1. At 4 p.m. on Thursday, June 26, it put out a press release saying that it would \u201chost a conference call on Monday, June 30 beginning at 8:00am EDT to present top line data from the Phase 2 MINDFuL trial in early Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\u201d Not saying the results, mind you, just saying that it would deliver the results on Monday.",
                "2. The stock traded up: Investors read that press release and thought \u201cooh, an announcement of trial results, probably they\u2019re good.\u201d The stock hit a high of $11.64 per share at 10:47 a.m. on Friday, June 27.",
                "3. On Friday morning, INmune agreed to sell $18.9 million of stock to \u201ctwo healthcare focused institutional investors,\u201d at a price of $6.30 per share, 2 cents above the $6.28 closing price of the stock on Thursday.",
                "4. On Friday at 12:16 p.m Bloomberg Terminal., it announced the stock sale publicly.",
                "Because the stock offering was a privately negotiated deal with two sophisticated investors, INmune didn\u2019t have to tell them the trial results: The investors signed a \u201cbig boy\u201d representation acknowledging that the company had material nonpublic information that it wasn\u2019t sharing with them. The purchase agreement said:",
                "<start quote>\nEach Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the Company is in possession of top line data from the Phase 2 MINDFuL trial in early Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (the \u201cPhase 2 Trial Results\u201d) and has announced that it will host a conference call on June 30, 2025 to present such Phase 2 Trial Results; (ii) the Phase 2 Trial Results constitutes material non-public information that could adversely impact the price of the Securities; and (iii) such Purchaser desires to proceed with the purchase of the Securities under this Agreement notwithstanding such pending Phase 2 Trial Results.\n<end quote>",
                "Why would the investors do this? If the clinical results are bad, the stock will trade down to, say, $2. (It hit a low of $1.89 this morning.) If the results are good, it will trade up to, say, $15. In a vacuum, you might say \u201cI think the chances of good results are 50/50, so paying $6.30 for the stock is a good trade.\u201d But you wouldn\u2019t do that trade with the company. The company knows the results! If the results are good, the company will announce them and sell stock at $15. If the company is selling stock to you at $6.30, you can guess that the results are bad.",
                "But there is a better answer. The investors can buy the stock and resell it immediately. The offering was a \u201c registered direct \u201d offering: Even though it was sold only to two institutions, it was structured as a public offering, INmune filed a prospectus, and the two investors got immediately tradeable stock. They also had no material nonpublic information: INmune knew the trial results, but the investors did not. They could just sell their stock whenever they wanted. [Footnote 1: Feurstein reports: \u201cThe funds immediately flipped (sold) the stock \u2014 instant profit.\u201d]",
                "On Friday morning, the stock was trading well above the $6.30 purchase price. Then the stock sale was announced and the stock started falling \u2014 it closed at $5.33 on Friday \u2014 but, still, the investors had a decent chance to get out at a profit. [Footnote 2: Just for fun, I looked at INMune\u2019s trading activity between 12:16 p.m. (the time stamp I see on the offering press release) and 12:46 p.m. on Friday, June 27. Bloomberg (page INMB US Equity AQR) shows me that 6.2 million shares traded in that half-hour window, at a volume-weighted average price of $6.68. The investors bought 3 million shares at $6.30. Could they have gotten out of all of it at a profit in that half hour? Seems like a lot (they\u2019d be 50% of volume), but not completely impossible. Total trading on Friday was 59.9 million shares (the company normally trades fewer than 1 million shares per day), so selling 3 million shares over the course of the day was totally possible. Also the purchase agreement specifically says that \u201cnone of the Purchasers has been asked by the Company to agree, nor has any Purchaser agreed, to desist from purchasing or selling, long and/or short, securities of the Company\u201d and that \u201cany Purchaser \u2026 presently may have a \u2018short\u2019 position in the Common Stock.\u201d So it is possible that the investors sold the stock short *before* they agreed to buy it.] (Why did the stock fall when the stock offering was announced? Presumably some combination of (1) everyone did the calculation I did above, which is that the company wouldn\u2019t be selling at $6.30 if the results were good, and (2) if the investors in the offering were selling, that would drive down the price. [Footnote 3: Plus \u201cdilution,\u201d which I suppose is always a worry in stock offerings for small companies.] )",
                "This doesn\u2019t seem like that much of a loophole: It was a registered offering, INmune had to file a prospectus, it did file a prospectus, and the prospectus had to (and did) include the disappointing trial results. From the prospectus:",
                "<start quote>\nOn June 30, 2025, the Company announced topline results from its Phase 2 MINDFuL trial evaluating XPro for early AD. The trial did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints in the modified intent-to-treat population (n=200). However, in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with amyloid-positive AD and multiple inflammatory biomarkers (n=100), XPro demonstrated cognitive and biomarker benefits, including improvements on EMACC and NPI-12, and reductions in plasma pTau217 and GFAP.\n<end quote>",
                "But the prospectus is dated Monday, June 30: The investors bought the stock, and possibly sold it, before the prospectus was published. INmune, like many US public companies, has a \u201c shelf registration statement,\u201d allowing it to do public stock offerings quickly. It could sell the stock to the registered direct investors, and they could resell it, using that generic registration statement. It just had to deliver an updated prospectus \u2014 describing the actual offering, and disclosing the trial results \u2014 before the offering closed: INmune couldn\u2019t take the investors\u2019 money, or give them stock, without delivering a prospectus, but it could agree to the trade before that. The closing is T+1 (one trading day after the offering), so Monday for a Friday offering. Technically INmune delivered the stock to the investors on Monday, along with a prospectus, but by that time they could already have sold it. [Footnote 4: Regular-way stock trades also settle T plus 1, so on Friday the investors could have sold the stock, even though they didn\u2019t have it yet.]",
                "This is a small, weird, occasionally lucrative niche in the capital markets. Sometimes a company cannot do a public offering of stock directly to retail investors, because it would create too much embarrassment and/or legal liability. But it can find an intermediary, some investment firm that will buy its stock and immediately turn around to sell it to the public, interposing some complication to save the company from the awkwardness. (The classic case that we have discussed around here is Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.) Here, INmune probably couldn\u2019t have sold stock directly to the public, but it could sell stock indirectly to the public, [Footnote 5: Not legal advice! One could raise objections; this does seem a bit unsporting to the people who bought stock on Friday.] and it did."

                "It used to be that most big well-known companies were public, but that is not as true anymore. Now a lot of big exciting tech companies \u2014 SpaceX, Stripe, OpenAI, etc. \u2014 are private, which means that you can\u2019t just buy them by clicking a button in your brokerage account. You need to know somebody. A lot of people want to buy shares in big exciting private tech companies, but it is hard for them to do so.",
                "Also, the fact that these companies are private means that, if you do own some shares, you can\u2019t just sell them by clicking a button in your brokerage account. You have to find someone to buy. Even though there is a lot of demand for these shares, it can be hard to cash out.",
                "One way to put this is that the bid/ask spread on private shares is really wide, particularly for individual investors without direct access to the companies. If some hot private company\u2019s stock is \u201creally\u201d worth $50 per share, and you want to buy some, you might have to pay $70. And then if you want to sell, you might get only $40.",
                "We talk about this dynamic all the time. We talked about it last week, because a crypto-y company is offering \u201ctokens\u201d on private-company stocks to, uh, possibly increase the supply. In December, we discussed a company offering SpaceX shares through a special purpose vehicle at roughly a 100% markup to the actual trading price of the shares: Institutions were buying SpaceX at $135 per share, but if you wanted in on that SPV, you\u2019d pay $258. Even that seemed pretty tame compared with DXYZ, the Destiny Tech100 fund, a closed-end fund that owns about $70 million of private-company stocks and has a market value of about $400 million; when we first discussed DXYZ, it traded at more than a 1,000% markup to the value of its underlying shares.",
                "Each time I discuss these things, I get emails from readers saying \u201cactually my broker is offering me SpaceX shares at a very reasonable markup.\u201d I am sure that\u2019s true. The point here is not that retail investors will always pay an enormous markup for SpaceX shares. The point here is that retail investors will pay an enormous range of markups for SpaceX shares: Some will pay 0%, some will pay 5%, some will pay 100%, some will pay 1,000%. There is not a simple single \u201cmarket price\u201d for private-company shares, the way there is for public-company shares. People can sell you private-company shares at pretty much whatever price you are willing to pay.",
                "Here\u2019s a Wall Street Journal article about Linqto, a company that \u201csaid it would make private equity investing easy, and \u2018democratize\u2019 the rarefied private markets.\u201d If someone in finance tells you that they are going to \u201cdemocratize\u201d anything, hold on to your wallet. Basically Linqto\u2019s business model was (1) acquiring shares of hot private companies and then (2) selling them to retail-ish [Footnote 6: The legal situation is that, for the most part, you can only sell private-company shares to \u201caccredited investors,\u201d meaning people who make at least $200,000 a year or have a net worth of more than $1 million. This is not all that high a bar, and I think it is fair to call Linqto\u2019s customers \u201cretail-ish.\u201d But also there are some exceptions to those rules, and Linqto did manage to find ways to sell private-company shares to non-accredited investors. The Journal reports: \u201cThe company even allowed some people who weren\u2019t accredited investors to participate in the deals. Among them was Thomas Lennon, 33, who in September 2024 invested $10,000 in Ripple \u2014 the minimum amount for a promotion offering investment \u2018slots\u2019 to 35 who weren\u2019t accredited, he said.\u201d (I assume the structure here is an SPV owning Ripple shares, with the SPV doing a Rule 506 offering to no more than 35 non-accredited investors.)] investors at enormous markups:",
                "<start quote>\nIn January 2023, the chief executive of the private stock investment firm Linqto announced a \u201cSpike Day,\u201d a one-day sprint to boost sales to its customers\u2014small investors looking for a shot at buying shares of coveted private companies. \u201cTake no prisoners,\u201d the now-former CEO, William Sarris, wrote in an email to staff, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThis is guerrilla warfare.\u201d Sarris was trying to unload shares of Ripple, a privately held crypto company, to Linqto\u2019s 11,000 users, at a price at least 60% higher than what Linqto paid. The Securities and Exchange Commission generally prohibits markups above 10% but Sarris pushed ahead, not disclosing the price hike to customers, and the company pocketed $2 million, according to people close to the situation.\n<end quote>",
                "Well, for a normal brokerage firm, buying stock and then reselling it to customers at a 60% markup would be quite high, but in the context of the 100% or 1,000% private-company markups we talk about around here, it\u2019s not that surprising. Meanwhile, the nature of the business is such that there will be fewer cases of the broker buying from customers at too low a price \u2014 mostly the customers want to keep their exciting private stocks \u2014 but not none:",
                "<start quote>\nLinqto didn\u2019t just profit from selling shares of private companies to users. Sometimes the deals went the other direction. At the end of 2023, Linqto learned that Ripple, which remains private, was preparing to buy back shares from customers at roughly $61 each. Linqto reached out to customers, who were in the black on their Ripple investments, and convinced them to sell 144,000 shares of Ripple back to the company at an average of $55 per share, according to people close to the situation. It then sold them all to the crypto company at the higher offering price, booking more than $8 million in revenue.\n<end quote>",

                "1. A bank makes $1 billion of loans to various companies, which pay, say, 6% interest.",
                "2. Those loans are somewhat risky, and regulators will require the bank to have a lot of regulatory capital in case they don\u2019t get paid back.",
                "3. But the bank can sell the first-loss piece to a hedge fund or other investor. The bank sets up a structure where the first $850 million of repayments, on the whole pool of loans, goes to the bank; the remaining $150 million goes to the hedge fund. If there are defaults and only $925 million of the loans actually get paid back, the hedge fund only gets $75 million, but the bank still gets its full $850 million.",
                "4. The first-loss piece gets packaged into a bond, which the bank sells to the hedge fund for $150 million, and the bank pays, say, 10% interest on that bond. (That is: The bank gets $60 million of annual interest on the whole loan portfolio, 6% of $1 billion, and pays $15 million of interest, 10% of $150 million, to the hedge fund.)",
                "5. The hedge fund takes more risk than the bank (it has the first loss), and it gets more reward (it gets a higher interest rate).",
                "6. The bank gets better capital treatment from its regulators: Instead of holding, say, $80 million of capital against the whole portfolio, the bank can hold, say, $8 million of capital against the much safer $850 million senior piece. The bank\u2019s cost of equity capital is higher than 10%, so paying the hedge fund to reduce capital requirements can be a good deal for the bank.",
                "There are variations on the structure, and the numbers here are illustrative and not meant to be taken seriously. [Footnote 8: Here are primers on the structure from the European Systemic Risk Board, A&O Shearman and the Managed Funds Association.] The point is just that the hedge fund takes the first loss, the bank takes the second loss, and this is a very common theme in modern banking. Banks are \u201cre-tranching\u201d: They are stepping back from taking certain economic risks (like making corporate loans), letting other players (hedge funds, private credit firms, etc.) take those risks, while the banks provide financing to those other players and take a more senior claim on the risks.",
                "There are various more-or-less economically equivalent ways to structure that tranching. In the abstract, the SRT looks something like \u201cthe hedge fund makes a $1 billion pool of loans, and the bank lends the hedge fund $850 million of non-recourse leverage collateralized by those loans.\u201d It\u2019s not quite set up that way \u2014 in part because the hedge fund doesn\u2019t have the corporate relationships required to originate those loans \u2014 but economically that is roughly the same thing as the SRT. (And in fact, elsewhere, private credit firms do have the relationships required to originate corporate loans, and they do, and banks lend them money against their loans, though usually not at 85% loan-to-value ratios.)",
                "And then there are some funds that are in the business of buying these SRTs, so some hedge fund will buy $150 million of this SRT and $100 million of another SRT and end up with a $2 billion portfolio of SRTs. And then, being a hedge fund, it will think: \u201cI have this big $2 billion pot of assets. It\u2019s a pretty good pot of assets: Sure, it\u2019s first-loss pieces of corporate loans, but it\u2019s diversified, and the loans were made by big banks to good companies, so they\u2019ll probably mostly get paid back. Perhaps someone would lend me, say, $1 billion against this portfolio. I\u2019d take the first loss \u2014 if $500 million of the SRTs don\u2019t get paid back, I\u2019ll lose $500 million and my lender will still get its $1 billion back \u2014 so the lender should feel pretty safe. And I can pay my lender a lower interest rate on the loan than I get on the SRTs, so I can juice my return on equity.\u201d",
                "And the hedge fund will call some banks, and one of them will probably give it that loan. Ideally not one of the banks that issued the SRTs, though. It is arguably a little awkward for a bank to sell its credit risk to the hedge fund (via SRT) and also finance that trade.",
                "Arguably it\u2019s a little awkward anyway. Bloomberg reports:",
                "<start quote>\nEuropean authorities are pushing banks to disclose more data on loans to investors who turn around and use the funds to help peers offload credit risk, according to a top regulator. Regulators want to ensure that risk is actually leaving the system when banks use significant risk transfers, or SRTs, to free up capital while keeping the assets on their balance sheets. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking for more transparency, more reporting information,\u201d Jose Manuel Campa, who leads the European Banking Authority, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Monday in London. \u201cPotentially you get a vicious circle by which a bank sells protection to somebody that\u2019s been financed by another bank.\u201d\n<end quote>",
                "\u201cBanks Transfer Risk to Themselves,\u201d is how I characterized the concern last year. SRT structures tend to be driven by regulation: The bank sells enough risk to the hedge fund to get the capital relief it wants; the regulator says, in effect, \u201cif you sell the 15% first-loss piece and keep the rest then you get to have less capital.\u201d If a bank then goes and lends 50% against the first-loss piece, then the banks collectively have 92.5% of the risk and the hedge fund has only a 7.5% first-loss piece, [Footnote 9: This isn\u2019t quite right, to the extent that the financing of the SRT might have margin triggers and create less economic exposure than a long-term loan at 50% LTV.] and that can look like cheating."

                "I wrote yesterday that \u201cI don\u2019t understand how anyone who works in artificial intelligence gets any work done,\u201d what with Mark Zuckerberg standing on their lawn with a boom box and a sack of money. It turns out that they don\u2019t. The Financial Times reports:",
                "<start quote>\nOver the weekend, Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI sent an internal memo saying that he felt \u201cas if someone has broken into our home and stolen something\u201d following recent staff departures. OpenAI has given staff the week off to rest and recharge, according to people close to the company. Chen added that Meta was trying to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of the planned break to pressure employees to make decisions on job offers.\n<end quote>",
                "I don\u2019t understand? They are so exhausted by getting offered so much money that they need a week off to hike, watch television, and not think about all the money Meta is offering them? And Meta is trying to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of that break by, you know, scheduling interviews with them during that week? That does seem \u2026 pretty obvious and predictable? Anyway, I also wrote yesterday that \u201cthe AI researchers have vast reservoirs of intrinsic motivation that I cannot begin to imagine (they just love AI so much),\u201d and the FT article also gets into that:",
                "<start quote>\nResearchers often prioritise the reputation of team leaders and the quality of work over the huge sums of cash being offered, according to AI recruiters. Researchers are \u201cincentivised by the type of work they\u2019re doing. And there\u2019s always a risk, if you end up in a Meta, you\u2019re not going to be doing the level of work that you might do at a DeepMind or an OpenAI, or an Anthropic,\u201d according to Firas Sozan, chief executive of Harrison Clarke.\n<end quote>",
                "One possibility is that Meta is the extremely cushy semi-retirement home for OpenAI researchers: You do good work at OpenAI, you make a name for yourself, and then when you get tired you take Zuckerberg\u2019s bag of cash, go to Meta, and sit around with your fellow extremely well-paid ex-OpenAI researchers reminiscing about the glory days when you used to do AI research instead of just polishing your Ferraris."
